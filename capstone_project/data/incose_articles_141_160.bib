abstract = {Abstract There is an increasing interest in expanding the capacity of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) to include the evaluation and design of social systems. System dynamics modeling can easily be utilized for such a purpose. This study investigates gender equality in the Norwegian pension system using system dynamics modeling and serves as an example of how MBSE can be used to evaluate social systems. Many women often do not work or work part time in their childbearing/rearing years, which affects their pension amount. In countries that implement policies to equalize the pension level between the genders, national policies center on enabling women to increase their lifetime working hours (e.g. national childcare policies for daycare). One country that is rather advanced in this policy area is Norway. Using system dynamics modeling, this paper explores how women are disadvantaged structurally in the Norwegian pension system in the context of social investment strategy and the dual earner/ caregiver relationship.},

abstract = {Abstract The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of systems (SoS) in every sense of the definition. A.P. Sage and others list five common SoS characteristics: operational independence of the individual systems, managerial independence, geographical distribution, emergent behavior and evolutionary development or independent life cycles. Typical examples include smart houses, the electric grid, complex military systems and so-called smart cities. The future of IoT success, including technology advancements and revenue generating potential across the business spectrum, is dependent on the application of solid Systems Engineering and Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principals. Without MBSE, the complexity involved in the design, development, and deployment of IoT systems would consume both system and operational providers. Absent of any industry standards, IoT systems cannot be built in a vacuum and their success will only be realized through application of modern day systems engineering processes, methods, and tools. With the potential of 28 billion “things” connected to the Internet by 2020, it's not too difficult for anyone paying attention to this emerging technology trend to envision the massive scale of social, economic, and technological changes that will need to occur to realize this prediction. Technology advancements in consumer products will continue to evolve to facilitate connection to larger and larger IoT networks. This will be the catalyst that will drive entire infrastructures changes to: Federal, State, City, and local governments; product development companies; utility and service providers; and even to consumers and their homes in order to support the growing demand for connected products. The infrastructure and management will need to be established prior to, or in conjunction with, the smart systems that support them. This paper will show a traffic management system and connected systems in a large city and how an MBSE and SoS approach will help guide development.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a natural choice for engineering complex systems of systems that involve hardware and software components, deal with a huge number of heterogeneous requirements, and require solid verification and validation at multiple levels. However, industrial MBSE adoption requires solving multiple problems. Most of them originate when MBSE is incorporated into the production environment. For enterprise-level industrial solutions, this means integration into the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tool chain. This integration covers requirements, product line, variability, design, simulation, BOM, configuration, version, and CAD drawings management. The problem is that there is no clear path for integration. Due to the various types of data that can be interchanged between PLM and MBSE, the existing integration solutions are patchy and driven by clients use cases only. There is not enough information about recommended MBSE – PLM integration practices, use cases, and methods. This is a huge problem in the context of large-scale partnerships working on mission-critical systems, where engineering data has to be processed and managed in the most consistent way so as to be used by all the partners and through the different PLM activities. In this paper we will overview real-world PLM and MBSE integration cases from our company experience. We will map a path toward the right solution, and will dive deep into the practical side of Product Line Engineering (PLE) and MBSE integration.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A system of systems (SoS) is a large complex system, with varying degrees of operational independence, managerial independence, evolutionary development, geographical distribution, and lifecycle independence. Critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid contains all the aspects of a SoS. Models are routinely used throughout the complete lifecycle of the grid during analysis, definition, construction, operation, maintenance, and more. Due to the ever-increasing complexity of the grid, a single model encompassing all aspects of the grid would be impossible. Typical projects I have worked on encompassed millions of telemetered points just to operate a small portion of the overall grid. When the detailed mechanics of the individual equipment as well as cyber security, connection to the Internet, the Internet of things (IoT), power trading components, co-generation, and other aspects are added, the problems quickly become too complex to analyze. Hence, we need to abstract the problem into a SoS set of aspects and examine the systems both at the SoS level, as well as the detailed level. This will require the use of standardized systems modeling tools such as the systems modeling language (SysML), and the unified architecture framework (UAF) to define the overall goals, strategies, capabilities, interactions, standards, operational and systems architecture, systems patterns, and so forth. Analysis using these standard methods can help identify potential problems that can be analyzed by specialty tools and the results fed back into the SoS model. This paper will examine the electrical grid as a SoS, define common characteristics, identify issues and vulnerabilities, and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) strategies for addressing them.},

abstract = {Abstract Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is now widely accepted throughout the industry, from commercial to aerospace and defense. However, while we understand and accept the principles of MBSE, successful adoption and implementation is still a challenge within the industry. The migration from document-based systems engineering processes to MBSE requires more than purchasing tools and a one-week course on Systems Modeling Language (SysML). MBSE does not change the practice of Systems Engineering as defined in the INCOSE SE Handbook or ISO/IEEE 15288, but it does affect the way in which systems engineering processes are implemented and supported within and across organizations. Organizations adopting MBSE must address issues such as new skill and competency requirements for systems engineers, model and data management over the lifecycle of the system, and integration with other engineering tools and processes, among others. It is not a tool problem or a modeler problem. It is an enterprise problem and requires an enterprise approach. The approach must be defined and guided by an enterprise architecture, which is broader than just the engineering tools and their interfaces. It includes the enterprise strategic vision, capabilities, operational concepts, organizations, and material solutions required to achieve MBSE adoption, how they relate to one another, and their evolution over time. This paper provides a broad overview of the fundamentals of MBSE adoption and the broader effort of digital engineering transformation, presenting the digital engineering environment as a system-of-systems. It presents the use of enterprise architecture as a roadmap for MBSE adoption within the industry.},

abstract = {Abstract Digital engineering can fundamentally change the construction and operation of complex projects. Traditional engineering teams operate in siloed tools and disparate teams. Throughout a project lifecycle, data is translated manually or over brittle point-to-point connections, which increases the risk of silent errors. These potential errors can cascade across the effort, resulting in significant project delays and cost overruns. Furthermore, traditional engineering projects are not designed for the rapid digitization that allows for advanced analytic tools. Digital engineering can create a cohesive data “source of truth” to ensure a project is designed for the digital future. There is a need for a standard toolset to normalize and integrate project datasets. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed DeepLynx, a crucial tool to mitigate this data management problem. This paper introduces INL's digital engineering approach and provides a concrete example of a digital engineering design effort currently taking place with Beartooth, a new nuclear material processing testbed project. This paper will provide the benefits, challenges, and lessons learned in using digital engineering on this complex system. The digital engineering approach is utilizing model-based systems engineering, extended reality, and a digital twin. Finally, this paper will discuss the new possibilities provided by using a digital thread and twin during future operation of a nuclear fuel cycle testbed.},

Implementation of this approach for cost estimation clearly depends on two critical items: (1) the ability to accurately and consistently count the size drivers; and (2) the ability to calibrate the model equation. As part of future work, they also describe the potential to use this approach as a management tool in architecture development – “a cataloging mechanism in organizing components of reference architecture.” This paper presents a practical implementation of the COSYSMO cost estimating relationship through extension of a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) modeling environment with SysML for estimating end-to-end systems engineering effort in developing a system. The approach provides a new way of rapidly creating cost estimates, conducting cost-based analysis and trade studies with full traceability from the cost estimation parameters back to the architecture of referenced system of interest.},

Results from this approach show and ease the way to obtain information in a complex and large model intended to simulate our System of Interest (SoI)/CCTs life cycle.

To maximize value delivery, “both” Systems Engineering and Decision Analysis are essential. The systems engineering profession has had a significant focus on improving systems engineering processes. While process plays an important role, the focus on process was often at the expense of foundational engineering axioms and their contribution to system value. As a consequence, Systems Engineers were viewed as process developers and managers versus technical leaders with a deep understanding of how system interactions are linked to stakeholder value‥ With the recent shift toward Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Systems Engineering is “getting back to basics,” focusing on value delivery via first principles, using established laws of engineering and science.

abstract = {Abstract The OMG Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysML™) is a general-purpose, graphical, modeling language for specifying, analyzing, designing, and verifying complex systems that may include hardware, software, information, personnel, procedures, and facilities. In particular, it provides graphical representations with a semantic foundation for modeling system requirements, behavior, structure, and parametric equations that can integrate with a broad range of engineering analysis. SysML represents a subset of UML 2.0 with extensions to satisfy the requirements of the UML™ for Systems Engineering RFP. The OMG SysML™ Specification was adopted in May 2006. For more information on SysML, including articles, tool vendor and related links, and the specification, go to http://www.omgsysml.org/. This tutorial provides an introduction to how SysML can address your systems engineering needs, including: background and motivation, an overview of the SysML diagram types and language concepts, a demonstration of how the language can be used throughout a Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) process. A class exercise is included to help solidify the student's understanding of the language. The course will also include a brief introduction to a typical SysML tool. Attendees should gain appreciation of the value of model-based Systems Engineering versus legacy, document-centric methods; awareness of the graphical notation; and a high level understanding of when and how a Systems Engineer can exploit the various diagrams and models as part of their systems engineering process.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The Systems Engineering Research Center (SERC) Pathfinder project in collaboration with INCOSE identified systems engineering research and workforce development needs. The results indicate five broad areas of systems engineering research needs in order of emphasis: mission engineering; agile development and engineering at the scale of the enterprise; model-based systems engineering; modeling and assessing system trust, security, and resilience; and development of pragmatic methods to deal with and to leverage increasing complexity and analytics, and leveraging machine learning for this purpose. Within INCOSE, the survey of Fellows worldwide emphasizes model-based systems engineering along with more general systems engineering modeling and measures. For both SERC and INCOSE, the results will guide priorities over the next two to five years.},

abstract = {Abstract Conceptual models describe, explain, and specify the function, concept, structure, and behavior of complex systems. Quantifying the contribution of conceptual models to stakeholder understanding of the systems-of-interest has been a great challenge. This difficulty has hindered justifying the use of formal modeling and simulation of complex systems and the adoption of a holistic model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. The informativity of a model is the value of the information it conveys. Conceptual system model informativity is a key performance indicator for MBSE. We introduce MIA – Model Informativity Analysis – a quantitative, utility-based, prescriptive approach for boosting conceptual models’ expressive power and measuring the value of the information they provide. We define an integrated informativity index, “I3“, which aggregates model scores of diverse informativity-enhancing factors. We demonstrate various aspects of MIA with Object Process Methodology, OPM – a model-based systems engineering paradigm and ISO-19450 standard. OPM caters to quantitative informativity analysis due its formality, comprehensive function-structure-behavior modeling, and bimodal equivalent graphical-textual representation.},
