abstract = {Abstract To date, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been deployed primarily in the product design domain. However, manufacturing system design problems are equally challenging, but there are many fewer design support tools in the hands of system designers. This paper describes how MBSE principles and methods can be used to make a powerful analysis tool readily accessible to manufacturing systems engineers. The MagicDraw™ SysML tool was used to create a domain specific language for electronics assembly, and the tool itself was customized to present an interface that was relatively easy for the manufacturing domain experts to use to create descriptions of products, resources, and processes. The domain specific language was mapped to a metamodel of the Arena™ discrete event simulation language, and the ATL© model transformation tool was used to automate the generation of the an instance of a simulation model from an instance of the electronics assembly system. The use of this kind of analysis automation can reduce by up to a factor of ten the time required to develop such simulation models.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) formalizes the practice of systems engineering through the use of models. This panel is intended to address considerations for incorporating MBSE into a broader multi-disciplinary engineering environment. Engineering disciplines use multiple languages and tools whose results are not always easily integrated. The lack of integration is a source of design discrepancies and errors. The potential for MBSE is that it provides a means to integrate multi-disciplinary engineering including systems, hardware, software, analysis, and test throughout the development life cycle. This panel will include representatives from other engineering disciplines to address questions such as: 1) What should other engineering disciplines expect from MBSE, and what should systems engineering expect from other disciplines to enable MBSE? 2) What can MBSE learn from model-based approaches used in other engineering disciplines? 3) How should the practices and tools be integrated/coupled across disciplines? 4) How are the system, hardware, and software models managed to ensure an integrated technical baseline? 5) How should a program be organized to achieve more effective utilization and application of model-based engineering? These are some of the questions that must be answered to more fully reap the benefits of MBSE.},

Besides, representation and logging of the assessment within the model result in a complete and up-to-date single source of information that can be used during the device certification as well. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive risk management SysML profile that includes interconnected safety analysis [functional hazard assessment (FHA), fault tree, and failure mode and effect analysis (FTA, FMEA)], control measure, and evaluation model elements in compliance with the medical standards. Model-based risk assessment of a point-of-care diagnostic device for sepsis has been shown as a case study to show the implementation of the profile. This device is a standalone unit and the test results obtained directly affect the patient. Therefore, both the top-down (FHA and FTA) and bottom-up (FMEA) safety assessment methods have been used. Another objective of the study is to define a systematic and holistic method to perform fault tree analysis, not only from the system architecture models but also from the functional, activity, and sequence diagrams of the system model.},

abstract = {Abstract Conceptual modeling is key to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches. OPM (Object-Process Methodology) and SysML (OMG Systems Modeling Language) are two state-of-the-art conceptual modeling languages. While both languages aim at the same purpose of providing a means for general-purpose systems engineering, these languages take different approaches in realizing this goal. As each of the languages has its relative strengths and weaknesses, ways to create synergies between them are considered in this work. We propose combining advantages of each language through automatic generation of several SysML views from an OPM model. To this end, we developed a new algorithm and software application for implementing the OPM-to-SysML views generation, and evaluated the results through an experiment conducted for this purpose. The formally constructed experiment described in this paper, which has been designed to test the quality of the auto-generated diagrams and their impact on system comprehension, indicates that the addition of some auto-generated SysML views to an OPM system model has increased system comprehension level. Our approach can benefit various stakeholders by promoting better system understanding, standardization, and improved interoperability. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 14:},

Divided in two modules computing respectively manufacturing and maintenance costs, the framework is based on a suite of statistical regression-based models whose results are aggregated in order to provide the best probabilistic estimate of lifecycle cost. The framework has been tested on components from civil jet engines but can be applied to a large variety of mechanical products.

Standards, procedures, and protocols are important anchors for interconnected systems: they facilitate the connectivity of billions of devices around the world, commodify advanced technologies and solutions, and enable efficient services involving trillions of transactions in aviation, medicine, e-commerce, transportation, infrastructure, and other domains. Domain protocols allow for conventional interactions within a domain among ecosystem entities and humans (eg, airline ticketing, financial transactions, etc). Protocol specifications must be formal, consistent, and verifiable. Nevertheless, most current standard protocols are text-based, unverifiable, and often inconsistent with themselves and with other standards. Text-based standards are difficult to manage, track, control, and adopt. MBPS includes three critical enablers: a modeling language, a modeling process, and a model-supported standardization process. This paper employs Object-Process Methodology (OPM), a model-based systems engineering framework, endorsed as ISO-19450, for modeling and simulation of the generic protocol specification process and for two examples: (a) a Kerberos authentication protocol revision based on a previous Kerberos model and on a recently discovered vulnerability and (b) a domain-specific Publish—Subscribe protocol application for selective information distribution.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an emerging technique widely used in current industry. It is a leading way expected to become a next generation standard practice in the systems engineering. Fundamental principles of systems engineering can be supported by a model-based approach to minimize design risks and avoid design changes in late development stages. The models can be used to formalize, analyze, design, optimize, verify and validate target products integrating engineering developments, organizations and products across domains. Though model-based development is well established in specific domains, such as software, mechanical system, electric systems, its role in integrated development from a system perspective is still a big challenge for current Chinese industry. In this paper, a survey from volunteers related with MBSE is taken by using questionnaires. The purpose of this survey is to highlight the usage and status of MBSE in current Chinese industry and address the rough understandings of MBSE concepts among system developers in China based on the answers about usages, advantages, barriers, concerns, trends of MBSE, particularly the perspective of tool-chain development.},

This (MBSE)2 approach is illustrated with example models of the MBSE System, showing how these models are used to inform the architecting process, monitor agile implementation of models, and facilitate model-based execution of SE reviews and audits. Summary For an enterprise to successfully implement MBSE, it must integrate models, datasets, tools, and infrastructure with appropriate processes, methods, and standards into a comprehensive, integrated MBSE System. This paper describes an approach that uses system architecting and MBSE principles and methods to architect this MBSE System, focusing on the descriptive models that serve as the foundation for MBSE. The approach has been named (MBSE)2 since it uses MBSE to architect and implement the MBSE System. This (MBSE)2 approach was illustrated with example models of the MBSE System, showing how system modeling tools can be used to analyze the MBSE System models to inform the architecting process, monitor the agile implementation of models, and facilitate the evolved execution of SE reviews and audits.},

abstract = {Abstract An ongoing challenge within the field of Systems Engineering is the application of a right-scoped and consistent approach to modeling human functions and risks within a system lifecycle. Humans interacting with a system can be modeled along a continuum from passive agents with not well-defined interfaces with the system operations, to essential personnel who are responsible for dynamic interactions that ensure the safety and correct function of the system. This paper seeks to contribute to the integration of a model of human function, response, and reliability into the systems engineering of a complicated system through translation of a Human Factors Hazard Model (HFHM) into the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The HFHM is constructed as a sequential event tree model of human response to triggering events, where each event's likelihood of failure is modeled by a set of fault trees predicting human failure probabilistically using Human Error Probabilities (HEP). Implementation of this model in SysML is demonstrated through a set of stereotyped structural, behavioral, and parametric diagrams. Integration of the HFHM within SysML demonstrates the benefits of human factors modeling and integration into Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) processes illustrating executability, reusability, and traceability.}

abstract = {Abstract This workshop is a practitioner's introduction to Pattern-Based Systems Engineering (PBSE), including a specific system domain illustration suitable for educational use. INCOSE thought leaders have discussed the need to address 10:1 more complex systems with 10:1 reduction in effort, using people from a 10:1 larger community than the “systems expert” group INCOSE currently reaches. Through the PBSE Project, the project team proposes to enable INCOSE membership, and the larger systems community beyond INCOSE, to achieve such order-of-magnitude improvements. PBSE leverages the power of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to rapidly deliver benefits to a larger community. Projects using PBSE get a “learning curve jumpstart” from an existing Pattern, gaining the advantages of its content, and improve that pattern with what they learn, for future users. The major aspects of PBSE have been defined and practiced some years across a number of enterprises and domains, but with limited INCOSE community awareness. A related tutorial was recently provided at the INCOSE 2012 Great Lakes Regional Conference, and well-attended.},

abstract = {Abstract In aerospace, automotive, health care, and other domains, the capability to effectively plan and perform system verification tests is increasingly a strategic differentiator. This paper reports on methods used to improve effectiveness of complex aircraft system tests, the gains achieved, and their connection to underlying methods and trends. These include use of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), leveraged by Pattern-Based Systems Engineering (PBSE) to generate configurable, re-usable system models--the focus of the INCOSE MBSE Patterns Challenge Team. (Patterns Challenge Team, 2013-2015) Distinctive aspects include (1) use of configurable, model-based patterns of system descriptions, including configurable system verification tests, (2) improved ability of model-based descriptions to integrate modeling tools and automated systems for test management, (3) use of models to describe both system under development and the development process, and (4) ability of these models to be integrated with other system life cycle management processes and information systems, for increased leverage.},
