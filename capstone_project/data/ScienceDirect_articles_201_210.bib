abstract = {A spurious actuation of an industrial instrumentation and control (I&C) system is a failure mode where the system or its component inadvertently produces an operation without a justified reason to do so. Design issues leading to spurious failures are difficult to analyse, but pose a high risk for safety. Model checking is a formal verification method that can be used for exhaustive analysis of I&C systems. In this paper, we explain how formal properties that address spurious failures can be specified, and how model checking can then be used to verify I&C application logic designs based on vendor-specific function block diagrams. Based on over ten years of successful practical projects in the Finnish nuclear industry, we present 21 real-world design issues (representing 37% of all detected issues), each involving a systemic failure that could lead to spurious actuation of nuclear safety I&C. We then describe how random failures of the underlying hardware architecture—another cause for spurious actuation—can also be included in the models. With an experimental evaluation based on real-world nuclear industry models, we demonstrate that our method can be effectively used for the verification of single failure tolerance.}

abstract = {With an increase in the use of small, modular, resource-limited satellites for Earth orbiting applications, the benefit to be had from a model-based architecture that rapidly searches the mission trade-space and identifies near-optimal designs is greater than ever. This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.}

This chapter provides an introduction to the object-oriented systems engineering method (OOSEM) and how it fits into the context of the overall development process, and then it shows how it is applied to the residential security example. The example described in this chapter illustrates how SysML is used as part of a model-based systems engineering method, called OOSEM, to solve a systems engineering problem. The top-down scenario-driven method flows the requirements down from stakeholder needs to component-level specifications, which include hardware, software, persistent data, and operational procedures. The OOSEM approach includes analysis of stakeholder needs, analysis of black-box system requirements, defining the logical architecture, synthesizing candidate physical architectures, and supporting activities to optimize and evaluate alternatives and manage requirements traceability. The method also supports the verification process in the up side of the Vee development process. The approach illustrates how different aspects of the system are analyzed to address a multitude of concerns related to system functionality, interfaces, performance, distribution, and life cycle considerations.}

Collaborative aspects are addressed by several research activities, namely Systems Engineering and more precisely by Model Based Systems Engineering. This work contributes a new method for interdisciplinary communication by an integrated visualization of conceptual models. The method describes an environment for direct communication between experts in related disciplines. Common application scenarios are business process management workshops in which process experts have to achieve commitment with experts from other disciplines like computer science, logistics or engineering. Especially in Industry 4.0 scenarios, mutual understanding between experts from several domains is crucial for a successful process setup, planning and preparation of production scenarios. The method comprises a theoretical framework for establishing inter-model relationships and their visualization. For establishing links between models, an ontology based approach is applied. The Bunge-Wand-Weber Ontology for information systems provides a generic and yet applicable basis for establishing consistent inter-model relationships. For supporting communication processes the integrated models should be displayed. To provide an understandable visualization a three-dimensional environment is proposed, in which the linked models are arranged and displayed. The scientific basis is given by applying the concept of visual variables described in the scientific discipline of information visualization. The depth of space extends the set of visual variables. Applied to the semantic concept of integrated models a discriminable visualization of integrated models is achieved.}

Although agile methods arose in IT software development, they have begun to be applied——with good success—in other engineering disciplines as well. In order to understand how best to apply them to systems engineering, a good understanding of the basic agile concepts, methods, and approaches is necessary. This chapter outlines the Agile Manifesto and restates it to be more relevant to systems engineering, including identifying the important measure of success—verified engineering data. The benefits of agile approaches are explained with an emphasis on the difference it can make to systems engineers. Key methodological approaches—incremental engineering, dynamic planning, continuous verification (of engineering data), continuous integration, and so on—are all explained in the context of systems engineering. The chapter highlights the key agile best practices for improving quality and efficiency in systems engineering and then outlines the Harmony Agile Model-Based Systems Engineering (Harmony aMBSE) process that integrates those best practices into a coherent approach.}

abstract = {Water consumption is emerging as an important issue potentially influencing the composition of future urban transportation networks, especially as projected urban populations are expected to outpace water availability and as alternative fuels and vehicles are being implemented in such regions. National and State policies aimed at reducing dependence on imported fuels and energy can increase local production of fuels and energy, impacting demand on local water resources. This article details the development of a model-based assessment on water consumption and withdrawal pertaining to the use-phase of conventional and alternative transportation modes based on regional energy and fuel production. An extensive literature review details water consumption from fuel extraction, processing, and distribution as well as power plant operations. Using Model-Based Systems Engineering principles and the Systems Modeling Language, a multi-level, multi-modal framework was developed and applied to the Metro Atlanta transportation system consisting of conventional and alternative vehicles across varying conditions. According to the analysis, vehicles powered by locally produced biofuels and electricity (assuming average local grid mix for charging) consume more water than locally refined gasoline and CNG-powered vehicles. Improvements in power plant technologies, electricity generation (e.g., use of solar and wind versus hydro power) and vehicle efficiencies can reduce such water consumption significantly. Total water withdrawal for each vehicle and fuel is significantly greater than water consumption.}

The value of formation flight is assessed using a coupled systems engineering and science evaluation model, driven by Model Based Systems Engineering and Observing System Simulation Experiments. Albedo errors are calculated against bi-directional reflectance data obtained from NASA airborne campaigns made by the Cloud Absorption Radiometer for the seven major surface types, binned using MODIS’ land cover map – water, forest, cropland, grassland, snow, desert and cities. A full tradespace of architectures with three to eight satellites, maintainable orbits and imaging modes (collective payload pointing strategies) are assessed. For an arbitrary 4-sat formation, changing the reference, nadir-pointing satellite dynamically reduces the average albedo error to 0.003, from 0.006 found in the static reference case. Tracking pre-selected waypoints with all the satellites reduces the average error further to 0.001, allows better polar imaging and continued operations even with a broken formation. An albedo error of 0.001 translates to 1.36W/m2 or 0.4% in Earth’s outgoing radiation error. Estimation errors are found to be independent of the satellites’ altitude and inclination, if the nadir-looking is changed dynamically. The formation satellites are restricted to differ in only right ascension of planes and mean anomalies within slotted bounds. Three satellites in some specific formations show average albedo errors of less than 2% with respect to airborne, ground data and seven satellites in any slotted formation outperform the monolithic error of 3.6%. In fact, the maximum possible albedo error, purely based on angular sampling, of 12% for monoliths is outperformed by a five-satellite formation in any slotted arrangement and an eight satellite formation can bring that error down four fold to 3%. More than 70% ground spot overlap between the satellites is possible with 0.5° of pointing accuracy, 2Km of GPS accuracy and commands uplinked once a day. The formations can be maintained at less than 1m/s of monthly ΔV per satellite.}

This chapter contains an example that describes the application of SysML to the design of a water distiller, intended for use in remote, undeveloped areas of the world. This example starts with a description of the problem, and selection of an appropriate approach to system modeling will follow. Because of the abstract nature of this problem, the system is developed using a traditional functional analysis approach, which is both familiar and intuitive to many practicing systems engineers. This approach is generally consistent with the simplified MBSE method. The example also illustrates its application to modeling physical systems with limited software functionality. Examples of each SysML diagram are used to support the specification, design, and analysis, along with leveraging some of the fundamental SysML language concepts such as the distinction between definition and use.}

abstract = {Safety issues are one of the core attributes of the projects of the New Space economy such as SpaceShipTwo and New Shepard. While these projects are on their way to shifting the paradigms in space tourism and transportation, the question of tourist safety remains in the cornerstone for a successful operations. One of the important questions we encounter when we start the development of complex systems such as the suborbital transportation and space tourism systems is: what are the concepts available and how can these concepts be represented using strictly defined ontology and model semantics? And finally – how this model-based information would support the system architect in keeping track of safety aspects? In this work we present a model-based concept framework that aims to address this issue. First a concept framework methodology is presented, after which we demonstrate its applicability to suborbital human spaceflight missions–SpaceShipTwo and New Shepard. The analytical conceptual difference between these concepts is demonstrated. The proposed framework includes: the information about the stakeholders and their needs; the solution-neutral environment (the problem statement) in which we formulate the functional intent; the solution-specific environment (solution statement) in which we see the possible solutions; the integrated concept revealed by means of the decomposition of such solution into internal elements and functions; and the concept of operations. Each one of these entries of the concept framework has a counterpart represented in conceptual modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM) or the System Modeling Language (SysML). Such a model-based concept framework encodes the core information required to define a suborbital tourism concept and represent it in a digital environment. We believe this will become a powerful tool to support the makers of architectural decisions that lead to concept and eventually to architecture, and that provides a safe operations for suborbital tourist services.}

Despite the significant advances in the development tools, developing the software of such systems while ensuring their safety is still a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end programming framework to ease the development of safe software systems. The programming framework, supported by a proper methodology and workflow, make it possible to design safe/secure software that implements functional requirements while respecting multiple non-functional requirements and mastering architectural complexity, time-to-market and cost. The programming framework is based on five concepts: (1) model-based system engineering: MBSE, (2) design-by-contract approach, (3) formal analysis of models based on symbolic execution, (4) code generation, and (5) static and dynamic code analysis. The effectiveness of the methodology has been demonstrated through multiple use-cases. The framework is realized using CEA LIST (http://www-list.cea.fr/en/) open-source development platforms: Papyrus, Frama-C, and UNISIM-VP. These platforms are results of many research and industrial projects such as FP7-SafeAdapt11SafeAdapt project was funded by the European Commission within the 7th Framework Program under the grant number “608945”., FUI-EQUITAS22EQUITAS project was funded by Bpifrance under call FUI-AAP16 with a contract number “F1312031-Q”., FP7-STANCE33STANCE project was also funded by the European Commission under the ICT theme of the 7th Framework Program with the grant agreement number “317753”., CATRENE-OpenES44OpenES project was funded under the CATRENE Program with the agreement number “CA703–2013”., FSN-SESAM Grids55SESAM Grids is a “Programme d'Investissement d'Avenir” project funded by “FSN-Briques Génériques du Logiciel Embarqué N°3” with contract number “O14830-67155”., and H2020-VESSEDIA66VESSEDIA project is funded by the European Commission under the SEC theme of the H2020 Framework Program with the grant agreement number “731453”..}
