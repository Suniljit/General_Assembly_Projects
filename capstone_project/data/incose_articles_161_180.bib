abstract = {Abstract The complexity of contemporary systems causes Systems Engineers great pains during early architectural design phases. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) proposes methodologies to deal with complexity and streamline design processes, but the penetration of the new approach is slow. This paper proposes a generic SysML based methodology for improving the Architectural Design phase of Systems and mitigate the barriers for MBSE adoption. The proposed methodology suggests an alternative way to formalize requirements, define design alternatives, automate design space exploration and examine optimization results in the original modeling format. A representative example is provided. A glossary is included at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is making its way into the design processes of many Systems builders. As with many other disciplines, MBSE can greatly benefit from the principles of reuse, but the very term assumes the existence of a large number of available models which may not be available due to the newness of MBSE activities. There exists, however, a great capital of artifacts from other domains, which Systems Engineering relates to and can leverage. This paper explores several practical examples of such approaches in the context of an architecture affordability study, reducing the effort and time required to identify a preferred architecture solution that is optimal for a given set of metrics including life cycle cost and system availability.},

The Working Group strives to achieve its vision through a series of activities conducted by members of the working group. One of these activities was to conduct a survey of people involved in MBCD, with the goal: To identify the issues associated with performing Conceptual Design and areas where MBCD has been successful. As part of this activity, two surveys, one in 2014 and one during 2015, have been conducted. This paper begins with an overview of the first survey and the need for a second survey that arose from the possibility of non-response bias being present in the first survey's results. Following this, the results obtained from the second survey are presented, compared with the results from the first survey and discussed. The key insights the authors uncovered from the results, survey workshops, and symposium presentations on both surveys are also identified. The paper concludes with a discussion on how these results are being used to inform current MBCD WG activities and strategic planning.},

abstract = {Abstract A Frenemy is “a person with whom one is friendly despite a fundamental dislike or rivalry.” (OED, 2018). The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and the Object Process Methodology (OPM) are two such frenemies. OPM and SysML are different means of achieving Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), each with their own benefits, issues, supporters and detractors. The National Defense Industry Association (NDIA) defines MBSE as “an approach to engineering that uses models as an integral part of the technical baseline that includes the requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and verification of a capability, system, and/or product throughout the acquisition life cycle.” (NDIA, 2011) SysML is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and includes diagrams that can be used to specify system requirements, behavior, structure and parametric relationships. SysML provides a means of defining high-level abstract systems down to detailed physical systems. OPM is a “conceptual modeling language and methodology for capturing knowledge and designing systems. Based on a minimal universal ontology of stateful objects and processes that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains.” (ISO, 2015) OPM is used in some systems engineering graduate courses. Students graduating from these institutions are struggling to integrate the differing styles, philosophies, concepts and processes of SysML and OPM. A literature search reveals some papers that contrast SysML and OPM, but none that describe how the two can work together. This paper discusses a synergy of SysML and OPM in a SysML tool rather than promoting one language over another.},

abstract = {Abstract Large infrastructure projects are complex, difficult and expensive. They are found in the transportation, energy, and communications sectors. These include projects for aerospace, and construction of public works and utilities, airports, sea ports, rail, highways and bridges, among others. They are subject to the requirements of a multitude of stakeholders, take many years to build, are often influenced by politics, and can lack focus or involve scope creep. They are also subject to laws and regulations, operational concepts, site conditions, external interfaces and utilities, industrial codes and standards, operator needs, the public interest and other influences. Projects often suffer several types of problems caused by inadequately determining, engineering and managing requirements. For example, contractual and regulatory commitments can be overlooked. Requirements do not flow down to subcontractors or suppliers. Requirements are incomplete, unclear and subject to widely varying interpretations. Projects have difficulty demonstrating requirements were met. Examples of projects where virtually all of these problems occurred include the Millennium Dome in the UK which was bankrupt shortly after opening (Projects, 2012), and the Freedom Tower (New World Trade Center) in New York City (Time, 2005). Solving these and other issues drive the need for more formal approach to managing these projects. There is a significant advantage to be gained by the adoption of systems engineering methods within the remainder of the infrastructure sectors. The INCOSE Infrastructure Working Group was formed to demonstrate how systems engineering can assist with infrastructure projects. As a part of that effort, we have created a drawbridge model to demonstrate how Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) can assist engineers in defining clear requirements, defining scope, demonstrating regulatory compliance, identifying stakeholders, etc. It uses the Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM) and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). This paper will describe the model and demonstrate how the different aspects of MBSE help infrastructure projects. The model contains close to 100 diagrams and reports, so size constraints of the paper mean that only selected parts of the model can be described.

abstract = {Abstract Current requirements for the reduction of CO2 emissions, as well as for the improvement of durability and reliability of sociotechnical systems such as passenger cars, lead to an increase in development effort in order to increase efficiency and system lifetime. Tribological systems play an essential role in the development of sociotechnical systems, but have proved to be particularly complex. The development of tribological systems, as part of the overall system under development, is an interdisciplinary effort. Involvement of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, rheology, and many more scientific disciplines is essential to cope with the high number of nonlinear relationships, which often cause unpredictable system behavior. This paper contributes to the scientific field of tribology by introducing concepts of model-based systems engineering for the specific case of elastohydrodynamic lubrication states. The elastohydrodynamic lubrication state of tribological system has been chosen as example to show how system models can be used to better describe the behavior of a system by connecting several specific models. In order to gain an overview of the models used in tribological system development, a system cube was used to structure the models. The system cube enabled gaps and overlapping model zones to be identified. Finally, the role of system models in development and the benefit of using system models to solve problems that cannot be solved by a single technical discipline but only in an interdisciplinary effort are discussed. An approach to connect models and methods to describe a system in an elastohydrodynamic lubrication state is presented.},

abstract = {Abstract As model-based systems engineering (MBSE) gains ground as a real alternative for complex industrial projects compared to the traditional plan or document-driven systems engineering paradigm, several challenges remain to be dealt with. MBSE requires not only the technological system-of-interest to be included in the common model repository used for MBSE, but also other elements and structures that are used to describe vital aspects of a complex technical project. This paper elaborates on how the primary planning document, the Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) can be evolved from the document-driven to the model-driven paradigm, and how some SysML diagram types along with architecture framework viewpoints may be used to model the most common content of a SEP. The evaluation is based on industrial experiences using MBSE in real-world industrial development and procurement projects. Several examples on how SysML may be used to represent SEP elements are presented along with suggestions on potential directions for further work.},

abstract = {Abstract As we continue to apply Systems Engineering and Model Based Approaches to the acquisition of complex and closely coupled systems, the ability to map, analyse and manage the interfaces across all the component elements of a capability presents a significant challenge. This paper provides an overview of the application of a Model Based Systems Engineering Approach to a case study, supported by the Whole-of-System Analytical Framework (WSAF), to manage the integration and acceptance of the Defence Lines of Development (DLOD) and its application to a case study in the United Kingdom (UK) defence acquisition domain. The approach seeks to provide the ability to conduct analysis of DLOD elements down to a significant level of granularity, including the inter- and intra-DLOD dependencies. The aim being to provide a comprehensive, consistent and systematic view of the DLODs across a complex and disparate stakeholder landscape. This supports the ability to manage the integration and acceptance of the DLODs which, when successfully effected, deliver military capability.},

abstract = {Abstract The distributed design of computer based systems requires a methodology that supports both the modeling of the distributed system and the ability to assess the impact of requirements and engineering change while the system is at any stage of development. Model Based Systems Engineering, MBSE, provides an approach to these twined problems with the advantages of tailorability to application, culture, notations, and tools. It is critical that traceability linkages be constructed in the normal course of engineering development and that they be adequate for an analysis of the impact of change.},
