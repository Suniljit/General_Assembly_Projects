abstract = {Abstract Modern surface combatants (hereafter considered as “systems-of-interest”) must accomplish a wide variety of missions, ranging from merely military, patrolling and constabulary roles to civil defense ones: the operational scenarios are much more complex than just a few years ago, and require that the whole warship is defined through deep configuration analyses, capable of simulating the effective theatres and leading towards the definition of the best fit for purpose solutions. This paper describes the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach employed by Fincantieri for the definition and analysis of the whole warship level architecture, starting from mission analyses, and generating NATO Architecture Framework (NAF) based engineering views to describe the response provided by the system-of-interest, represented – in this specific case – by the new first line Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) surface combat units for Royal Australian Navy's (RAN) SEA5000 program. Many benefits derive from the implementation of the MBSE/NAF approach (such as the continuous traceability among the different domains of the architecture, the optimization of communications between customer and supplier, and a solid support for the verification of the Whole Warship performance), as discussed in the following chapters, and summarized in the conclusions. The system offered to RAN strictly derives from a consolidated system of success, which is currently employed by the Italian Navy (Marina Militare Italiana – MMI) in inter-forces NATO missions: Fincantieri has in fact identified the Italian FREMM (European Multi-Mission Frigate; Italian: FRegata Europea Multi-Missione) ASW class frigate as the optimal reference ship, which can be suitably tuned to achieve the goals intended by the customer in the new operational environment.},

abstract = {Abstract The prevalence of model-based systems engineering tools has created a once-in-a-generation opportunity for engineering organizations to dramatically improve productivity by re-using common design elements when creating new product variants. To recognize these engineering productivity improvements, a library of model-based reusable elements can incorporate key product design structures encompassing requirements, architecture, behavior, interfaces and tests. Unfortunately, simply using a systems model does not translate into reusability of those designs on another programs. The author's previous studies have shown real cost savings when deploying re-use libraries: For example, when re-using just common requirements defined on previous programs, organizations save as much as 40\% of each systems engineer's time with a return on investment exceeding of 328\%. This paper describes the key considerations and basic process of building a library of model-based re-usable elements and explores the investment required and utility of such a library.},

abstract = {Abstract Systems engineers and product support managers often approach building the “best” or “right” system from different perspectives. Systems engineers focus on technical solutions that meet system requirements and maximize capabilities, while product support managers focus on optimized sparing levels and reduced supply chain delays. These tendencies lead to design decisions that do not optimize system readiness over the system life cycle. As programs evolve to deliver systems in today's budget constrained environment, several are adopting model-based engineering approaches. The emphasis in acquisition is often to capture system requirements and architecture definition through a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. There is a significant opportunity to integrate model-based product support (MBPS) practices with MBSE through concept and development to enable a decision support capability that effects optimized sustainment costs and demonstrates impacts on system readiness in design trades.},

An integrated environment provides the opportunity to document the system definition consistently and aid in performing trades and analyses throughout the product lifecycle, starting with abstract ideas and concepts and continuing until detailed physical architecture elements are determined and verified.

abstract = {Abstract Traditionally, engineering encourages requirements statements that are objective, testable, quantitative, atomic descriptions of system technical behavior. But what about “soft” requirements? When products deliver psychologically or emotionally-based human experiences, subjective descriptions may frustrate engineers. This challenge is important for products appealing to senses of style, enjoyment, fulfillment, stimulation, power, safety, awareness, comfort, or similar emotional or psychological factors. Automobiles, buildings, consumer products, packaging, graphic user interfaces, airline passenger compartments and flight decks, and hospital equipment provide typical examples. This paper shows how Model-Based Systems Engineering helps solve three related problems: (1) integrating models of “soft” human experience with hard technical product requirements; (2) describing how to score traditional “hard” technology products in terms of “fuzzier” business and competitive marketplace issues; and (3) coordinating marketing communication and promotion with the design process. The resulting framework integrates the diverse perspectives of engineers, stylists, industrial designers, human factors experts, and marketing professionals.},

Part of this limitation stems from the fact that the ability to monitor, predict, and enhance soldier and squad performance is a complex System of Systems (SoS) undertaking. To address this integration challenge, we developed a comprehensive conceptual framework that maps mission-level success to measures of task effectiveness and human performance that quantify the impact of emerging technologies and interventions. In addition, by leveraging lessons learned from a previous effort that developed a Wearables MBSE system architecture (MBSE-SA) and methodology for military health monitoring systems, we developed a Human Performance MBSE-SA to capture and apply the conceptual framework, which provides the foundation for several system-level and program-level analyses, including gap identification. This paper presents the Human Performance MBSE-SA and an illustration of its utility in showing the connections among ongoing military research efforts, strategic source requirements, and operational use cases.},

abstract = {Abstract Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are critical for the safe operations of complex, hazard-sensitive systems. The SOPs are particularity important for dealing with non-normal operations in which the human operator must intervene and/or provide instructions to the automation. Under these rare circumstances, the appropriate human operator actions are defined by SOPs. The SOPs must be completed within an Allowable Operational Time Window (AOTW) to avert a hazardous outcome. In many cases, the AOTW is not fixed, but exhibits variance due to complex non-linear, plant dynamics. The Time on Procedure (ToP) is also subject to variability due to human factors such as experience, proficiency, fatigue, and the efficacy of the SOPs and the supporting automation user-interface. For this reason, it is critical to evaluate the dynamic performance of the SOP in the context of the operations and determine the likelihood of the ToP exceeding the AOTW. This paper describes how to model SOPs and perform SOP analysis using LML/SysML Action/Activity Diagrams that can be found in most Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) tools. The method enables the SOP designer to assess the performance of the SOP by accounting for human factors and operation dynamics. The ability to test the procedures in a MBSE tool can inform the system design and verify the procedure design early in the development life-cycle. The implications and limitations of this approach are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract As the evolution of new technologies such as IOT and Cloud Computational Analysis continue, the Systems have become more and more complex and it is grown much in size. Unfortunately the present day SE Environments, Modeling languages and the related tool sets are not sufficient enough to represent the multiple streams problem at hand in one integrated modeling environment which makes all of the Stakeholders and Engineers \& Non-engineers understand the problem scenarios. This lack of integrated modelling environment and a methodology for an additional representation of multiple problem domains limits off the analysis capabilities, timely communication of the technical and project risks to various stakeholders for decision making. It happens due to the inherent capability \& limitations of each modeling languages followed so far by the Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) community \& to bridge across them. This research paper focuses on improving the SE modeling environment capability from at least three distinct directions. First, it proposes a way to strengthen the SysML semantics with concrete guidelines which helps to reduce the incompleteness \& ambiguous nature of the SysML elements especially in the Non Functional Requirements modeling. Then it explores the possibility of integrating the ontology aspects offered in evolving Life-cycle Modeling Language (LML) specification to an extended SysML profile to complement its constructs to facilitate communication with non-system engineers as well. Finally, this paper draws parallel between the LML architectural modeling concepts with the Architecture Analysis \& Design Language (AADL) constructs and realizes them in an extended SysML profile. This will facilitate the seamless flow of models at various abstraction levels \& translation of architectural model information from LML to AADL analytical environment. A case study implemented using an extended SysML profile \& a methodology will be presented to measure its effectiveness.},

However, the promise of improved performance and illness prevention through these technologies remains unfulfilled because of the complexity of guaranteeing that technology development outside of the standard military acquisition cycle will meet military requirements. The key to meeting this challenge is to facilitate coordination among R\&D efforts, commercially developed products, and military acquisition strategies. To address this, we developed an MBSE architecture and methodology for validating independently developed wearable system designs against military end-user needs. This methodology includes developing a conceptual framework, a model library, and a capability needs matrix that maps defense mission characteristics to physiological states and product design implementations. This architecture allows military stakeholders to determine where capability gaps or opportunities for wider application of commercial technologies exist, thus providing a bridge between externally developed wearable sensing technologies and military acquisition strategies.},

abstract = {Abstract Model based systems engineering (MBSE) has been accepted worldwide by many industries, including the automotive industry, for several years. Hundreds of projects have already been developed and deployed using MBSE approaches. MBSE is gaining importance because it provides systems advantageous life cycle processes, such as returns of investments and meeting the demands of global marketplaces, as they become increasingly complex. Consequently, the number and pace of deployment using MBSE approaches will increase in the future. Our current work objective is to define a generic MBSE methodology compatible with Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBOK) functional decomposition principles, ‘Automotive open systems architecture’ (AUTOSAR) developments and compliant to ‘Automotive software performance improvement and capability determination’ (ASPICE) processes using the ‘systems modelling language’ (SysML). We have proposed a generic SysML process framework, a hierarchical system of systems (SOS) engineering approach and automation solutions. We have shown that the proposed solution helps meet the defined objectives. The work is targeted and relevant for automotive industry MBSE practitioners. In general, the research, apart from transportation and mobility industries, can also be used in other industries.},

abstract = {Abstract Component-Selection is an important task in design synthesis of MBSE. A trade study is commonly used to help systems engineers and stakeholders selecting the components of a systems design. A simple analysis may be sufficient when it involves only two parameters. However, when the components and their integration become more complex, the trade study also becomes harder, time- and cost-consuming, and error-prone. This paper aims to propose a method to automatically generate the solution by performing an evolutionary search. Sample components of a hybrid car which consists of an engine, an electric motor, and a battery are used in our initial prototype. The logical architecture is represented in the OMG SysMLTM via CSMTM. Through the experimental result, this paper shows that the proposed technique allowed the system design to be efficiently selected.},

abstract = {Abstract The Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical Systems (SWFTS) is a rapidly evolving combat system of systems (SoS) product family. Managing the annual baseline updates requires processing thousands of baseline change requests, then coordinating and verifying their implementation. The complexity of this effort, which involves well over ten million source-lines-of-code (SLOC) as well as Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and military-unique hardware, is compounded by being deployed in ten variants. After a feasibility study in 2010 the SWFTS systems engineering and integration program started a transition from traditional requirements database and document-centric systems engineering (DCSE) to a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) process. At that time there was little solid evidence in the literature for a positive Return on Investment (ROI) for moving from DCSE to MBSE. Applying MBSE to this program has resulted in measurable monetary and operational benefits. We 1) summarize the DCSE to MBSE transition, 2) describe the accomplishments and observations to date, 3) define the metrics collected, and 4) quantify the achieved ROI. Background on the systems engineering and integration (SE\&I) process and an apples-to-apples comparison of SE quality and efficiency are provided. The raw SE\&I efficiencies of the DCSE and MBSE approaches are documented, along with conclusions showing that the MBSE approach delivers a positive ROI through higher quality SE products at significantly less cost-per-change, enables managing more baselines and SoS complexity using constant resources, and reduces the cost of the downstream integration effort.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents the sharing of our experiences and lessons learned to modernize a warship with C6ISR utilizing the digital engineering MBSE models of complex systems. We captured Enterprise Architecture (EA) DoDAF views, KPP and KSA in Capability Views (CV). At the EA, information passes into domain specific SoS Block Definition Diagrams (BDD) and Internal Block Diagrams (IBD) to interface and exchange information via SysML models and generate the Interface Control Document (ICD) automatically. The paper illustrates the mapping of EA with SoS digital models and tracing from EA to SoS MOE, MOP, MOS and TPM. The paper applies a Use Case to exemplify OOSEM life cycle activities for requirements traceability. The paper has demonstrated that both EA and SoS are derived from Systems Engineering (SE) process and can be validated and verified via the “V-Model” and endorse the noticeable reduction in the total development cost per complex systems project.},
