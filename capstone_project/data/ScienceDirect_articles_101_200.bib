Furthermore, the study aims at providing conceptual models that enhance a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with the purpose of taking into account knowledge management (KM). The research formulates a decision model that complements the existing methods through Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The methodology is based on current SysML diagrams and proposes a KM solution focused on an organizational approach. The requirements satisfaction is built on this conceptual approach to help on the decisional process. Systems Engineering (SE) integrates all the disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort forming a structured development process from design to production. SE shows that cooperative work and management increase with the complexity of systems. Thus far, the current models do not present enough cooperative and knowledge management supports. The study proposes to add a new model to imply KM and organizational aspect through SysML in order to develop a cooperative work process with a first conceptual approach. This paper tackles several possibilities based on modeling language SysML extension and discusses the interest of implementing the model while providing a complementary decision-making tool.}

Introducing any significant change into an organization requires a well-thought-out plan and disciplined implementation to be successful. SysML to an organization and projects should be planned as part of an initiative to improve the systems engineering process, methods, tools, and training. This chapter describes how to implement an improvement process to facilitate a smooth and successful transition to SysML as part of a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. The transition to SysML should be implemented using the organization's improvement process as part of their transition to a model-based approach. Clear responsibility for the improvement initiative should be established, and the expected cost and benefits of the change should be understood and agreed on with stakeholders. A successful deployment must be planned, piloted, and incrementally deployed. Success of the modeling effort is a key ingredient to motivate other projects to follow. The result of the modeling effort, including its benefits and lessons learned, should be quantified, where practical, and used as a basis for future deployments and improvements.}

abstract = {Context
Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged to be the next generation of engineered systems driving the so-called fourth industrial revolution. CPSs are becoming more complex, open and more prone to security threats, which urges security to be engineered systematically into CPSs. Model-Based Security Engineering (MBSE) could be a key means to tackle this challenge via security by design, abstraction, and automation.
Objective
We aim at providing an initial assessment of the state of the art in MBSE for CPSs (MBSE4CPS). Specifically, this work focuses on finding out 1) the publication statistics of MBSE4CPS studies; 2) the characteristics of MBSE4CPS studies; and 3) the open issues of MBSE4CPS research.
Method
We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) following a rigorous protocol that was developed based on the state-of-the-art SMS and systematic review guidelines. From thousands of relevant publications, we systematically identified 48 primary MBSE4CPS studies for data extraction and synthesis to answer predefined research questions.
Results
SMS results show that for three recent years (2014–2016) the number of primary MBSE4CPS studies has increased significantly. Within the primary studies, the popularity of using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) is comparable with the use of the standardised UML modelling notation. Most primary studies do not explicitly address specific security concerns (e.g., confidentiality, integrity) but rather focus on security analyses in general on threats, attacks or vulnerabilities. Few primary studies propose to engineer security solutions for CPSs. Many focus on the early stages of development lifecycle such as security requirement engineering or analysis.
Conclusion
The SMS does not only provide the state of the art in MBSE4CPS, but also points out several open issues that would deserve more investigation, e.g., the lack of engineering security solutions for CPSs, limited tool support, too few industrial case studies, and the challenge of bridging DSLs in engineering secure CPSs.}

The literature on PSS explains the content of a business model mostly from the provider’s perspective with a clear operational positioning. This paper considers the strategic positioning of stakeholders in the early stage of the process of value co-creation. More precisely, this paper aims at providing a comprehensive conceptual model that integrates both strategic and operational perspectives of a business model, which is considered here as a system of value co-creation. A system modelling approach, by coupling two modelling methodologies, is proposed. Goal Modelling (GM) is used for the strategic perspective, and Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) for the operational one. GM allows modelling high-level objectives that stakeholders expect from a given system, whereas MBSE supports formal modelling of the engineering process. Combining both modelling frameworks makes it possible to visualize the entire system from strategic and operational perspectives as a unique socio-technical system. The aim of this work is to support the value co-creation process in the early stages of PSS design through the visualization of its key elements (e.g., actors, goals, PSS offers, activities, among others). The implementation of the modelling framework is illustrated through a real example of a French company with respect to the provision of safety clothing for its employees.}

abstract = {Increasing system complexity requires adapted methodologies to tackle the challenges that come along with multi-domain systems development. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides significant support by using models to describe different aspects of an examined system already in the early stages of the development process. The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) can be utilized to establish a common system information basis on a comparatively abstract level for all participating stakeholders. Although SysML models are able to encompass system information like requirements, structure, behaviour and parametrics, in many cases additional specialized simulation or computation models are needed, especially for early design decision-making and verification activities. Ideally, the input data and the calculated results are automatically exchanged between the SysML modelling editor and the involved simulation tools. Hence, tool chain integration is a crucial factor to provide the necessary interconnectivity to achieve multi-domain simulation. In general, the integration of simulation environments with SysML tools is mainly limited by two factors. First, as the tools available for modelling with SysML are legion, interface solutions are usually developed for a specific tool and therefore, their usage is restricted to that particular software. Second, evolving standards like the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) provide capabilities to ease model data exchange and co-simulation, but the implementation of different versions of various standards in the tools causes incompatibilities. In this work a state of the art of the integration between simulation environments and available SysML modelling tools with respect to utilized standards and their implementation maturity is presented. Additionally, the capabilities of the reviewed tools to support co-simulation are evaluated. Furthermore, existing challenges are highlighted, and potential improvements are discussed.}

IFS is comprised of distributed and heterogeneous systems that accomplish low-level and high-level information fusion (LLIF and HLIF) functionality. LLIF and HLIF functions are developed independent from one another but require collaboration to achieve the IFS mission objectives. The distribution and heterogeneity of systems, in addition to the multiplicity of LLIF and HLIF functions, creates an extensively large design space for the IFS. We apply a SoS engineering architecting process to obtain integrated architectures of IFS and propose guidelines to constrain an otherwise infinite design space of Information Fusion System-of-Systems (IF-SoS). Furthermore, we elaborate a multi-agent system modeling approach and pair it with Design of Experiments for objective evaluation of the IF-SoS design space. The statistical analysis, based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) Range Tests, quantifies the impact of interactions between LLIF and HLIF design considerations on the IF-SoS performance. Furthermore, statistical evidence is provided to demonstrate that the interactions among JDL levels, in particular between LLIF and HLIF, are the most significant design considerations for fusion performance which necessitate an integrated design and evaluation of LLIF and HLIF—a manifestation of the SoS perspective for the IFS.}

The framework will be defined around a collaborative architecture based on a commercial Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS), ARAS Innovator, which supports connecting software tools to develop and define models and its lifecycle. The framework, called Model Lifecycle Management (MLM), has been tested with several aerospace and non-aerospace use cases and is the core software tool supporting the MfM methodology. MfM methodology has been proposed by the authors as a new approach to apply MBSE concepts to Manufacturing, and aims to provide a set of processes, methods and associated tools to support the discipline of manufacturing in a model-based context.}

As a result it is possible to define an early conceptual design of the assembly line and its basic parameters. Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) comprises ordering of tasks among stations to satisfy precedence constraints. Due to the specific features of an aircraft, such approach is not fully suitable for the case of an aerospace assembly line where the number of stations relates to technological criteria rather than to a calculation aiming to minimize a specific parameter. This paper presents a preliminary ontology definition for aerospace assembly lines in the Airbus context using Model for Manufacturing (MfM) methodology. The authors implement a new approach to characterize mono configured aerospace products. This new approach lets maximum flexibility in the shopfloor implementing the adherence characteristic and is developed using a novel methodology, MfM. The new approach for modelling manufacturing systems has been coined as an extension of the previous authors’ research to introduce MBSE (Model Based Systems Engineering) concepts in manufacturing. A preliminary ontology based on MfM is developed and proposed to represent an aerospace assembly line using the innovative concept of adherence to assembly stations. The model scope is the configuration of the design solutions against manufacturing solutions, and the arrangement of them in a network of networks. The ontology definition is based on the DA08 artifact, used by authors in several researches, supporting the models currently in development and the next steps.}

Research has traditionally addressed the process of identifying stakeholders using stakeholder-centric methods such as brainstorming (unstructured or with discipline-specific taxonomies). These approaches are grounded on the idea of listing entities that have a relation to the system and then analyze their mutual relationships so that their relative importance with respect to the system can be assessed. Yet, these methods do not provide any mechanism to ensure completeness and thus introduce a high level of uncertainty in the definition of the problem at the beginning of the system life-cycle. The present research proposes instead a contextual- and behavioral-centric approach for stakeholder identification. Using systems thinking the focus is put on understanding all the underlying relationships, be them complex or simple, of the system within its environment and during its existence by comprehensively modeling its socio-technical context and behavior. As a result stakeholders no longer need to be sought, but they comprehensively emerge out of the holistic understanding of the system.}

The conceivable development of information and communication technology will enable advanced mechatronic systems. Their manifold system functions, the cross-linking of elements within the system and their hardly manageable interactions induce a much higher complexity in the development process and make it much more challenging than today. As approaches of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) get more and more accepted within industry, they can be the foundation for a better management of the product development process. Due to this, we state that model based systems engineering forms the basis for systems engineering management to ensure, that project targets are achieved. In this contribution we point out, how a discipline-spanning system model can be used as the core of system engineering management: We introduce a modelling technique and its utilization for project planning as well as assessment and control. We present approaches for planning operational structures as well as technical reviews and further for measuring development progress and product maturity on different system hierarchy levels, using the information modeled within the system model.}

abstract = {In today’s mechanical engineering companies, the rising interdisciplinarity of processes and development teams as well as distributed company locations leads to increased production times and more complex product development processes (PDP), although shorter development times are requested. Especially changes, e.g. component optimization or changed customer requirements, as well as parallel sub-processes, require increased planning to make dependencies visible and estimate expenses. When requesting a change to e.g. a component property, it is difficult to identify on the one hand which processes and technical parameters are affected and on the other hand which stakeholders have to be included in the decision making. It is not yet state-of-the art that stakeholders affected by a change in the PDP are identified and notified automatically by the IT-system. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify indirectly connected stakeholders, which are not linked to changing properties or processes, concerning the changes made. In this paper, a methodological approach is presented, that links the technical parameters with the processes and the different stakeholders, using the example of a PDP for light weight composite components. The procedure comprises the implementation of the PDP for light weight composite, including the process-dependent roles, in a product data management (PDM) system. The process structure is then linked to a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tool. By building a system model, the product parameters are linked to the processes and roles. Using the established system model, the direct and indirect dependencies between the technical parameters and the stakeholders are visualized.}

abstract = {Systems Development for Space Missions is an engineering challenge that requires a highly integrated systems design approach. Multidisciplinary dependencies, project size, technology novelty, and diverse operational environment conditions increase overall systems complexity. Therefore, systematic validation and verification techniques that consider environmental and operational conditions are crucial for mission success. However, verification and validation of system requirements is hard to achieve under real conditions since physical prototyping tests in space environment are hardly possible. Virtual Testbeds are a promising approach for the early identification of technical risks by simulating the overall system with approximate real conditions, and thus, increase the overall engineering efficiency. They enable early feasibility studies and virtual commissioning of the system during integration phase. The application of virtual testbeds requires not only a formal specification of the System Under Development (SUD) but also a formal Specification Technique for Validation and Verification (V&V). However, existing MBSE approaches provide only poor concepts for a holistic specification of system Test Cases and Virtual Testbeds. In this paper, we propose an integrated Model-Based Specification Technique that facilitates an integrated specification of the system and relevant V&V aspects. We first analyze existing norms like VDI 2206 and ECSS-Std. in order to identify relevant V&V aspects. Second, we describe a specification approach for Virtual Testbeds. Third, we present a modeling language for the specification of those aspects. Finally, we apply the presented technique on an example from the space robotics domain. Our findings show that the presented technique helps to capture relevant V&V aspects according to the existing norms in the space robotics domain. However it is not limited to space and can easily be used for industrial and other complex mechatronic systems.}

Model-Based Systems Engineering is a methodology that allows for traceability and guarantees model consistency covering the entire lifecycle of the system. The objective of this work is to develop a holistic model of a process plant. Such model will be available during the entire lifecycle of the system (process+product) communicating in every stage with the specific (existing) tools used to develop it. In this paper, we present the development of the SysML model of a process plant (the production of ethylbenzene from benzene and ethylene), the architecture and the methodology to transform the central model to application-specific ones. We also explain how to execute these specific models from the core model keeping consistency between models and data.}

In fact, the large number of applicability conditions makes the use of real-time scheduling analysis tedious and error-prone. Key issues are left to the engineers: when to apply a real-time scheduling analysis? What to do with the analysis results? This article presents an approach to systematize and then automate the analysis of non-functional properties in Model-Based Systems Engineering. First, preconditions and postconditions define the applicability of an analysis. In addition, contracts specify the analysis interfaces, thereby enabling to reason about the analysis process. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of our approach using a combination of constraint languages (REAL for run-time analysis) and specification languages (Alloy for describing interfaces and reasoning about them). This approach is experimented on architectural models written with the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL).}

The increasing complexity of mechatronic products and production systems with Industry 4.0 technology reinforces the demand for a method that supports engineers in decision making in both technical and strategic issues. By using the method presented in this contribution, interdependencies between product functions, product features and the corresponding production processes and machines can be modelled and used to estimate the impact and risks of changes in one of those domains. Using the method, the change propagation of variations in and between the domains can be evaluated. The objective of the method is to support decision making in different use-cases like integrated product- and production system development, product variations while carrying over most of the production system or varying production processes while carrying over the product to improve production key performance indicators (KPI). Based on the model of PGE – Product Generation Engineering, the information of the reference system is used to identify the interdependencies. The inclusion of strategic factors like know-how and costs is implemented in the model, as well as the quantity and type of variations. The method consists of a representative model for a quick, holistic overview about the interdependencies and of a tool based model by using Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) for an automatic connection and evaluation of the data.

In prior work we make an explicit connection between the architectural diagrams of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), parametric cost estimation, and network science. Specifically, by treating the DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF) Systems View 3 (SV3) as an adjacency matrix, we assess how the addition of a new subsystem to an immature architecture might grow the existing network. With the subsequent application of parametric cost modeling, we translate anticipated growth into expected cost, thereby quantifying the impact of change. This paper refines that approach. In particular, by using the Girvan-Newman algorithm, the SV3 is initially divided into groups of subsystems such that the number of interfaces is dense within and sparse between groups. Based on this division into “architectural communities” and the prevalence of bridging ties, interfaces generated by the addition of a new subsystem can be faithfully integrated into the existing architecture, adding validity to our growth mechanism. This procedure is illustrated in detail with an example that highlights the importance of this refinement, and it is incorporated within a Monte Carlo simulation that allows the distribution of future costs to be estimated and assessed.}

Information is lost due to team dynamics, inappropriate documentation and methods, resulting in unnecessary design iterations, repeated problem-solving, lack of effectiveness and value, and low financial performance. It is, therefore, desirable to develop a documentation model that can be integrated into different engineering processes and used to effectively communicate product information within a single project and between projects, combining strategies from product design methodology, model-based systems engineering, and lean development. It is necessary to combine the most recent product (systems) engineering methods with the understanding of problems and needs in industrial environments where they shall be applied. This paper presents results of need finding in four companies using a semi-structured interview approach to gain insight into problems associated with product documentation. The findings are turned into a conceptual engineering-driven product documentation framework, which links documentation to the product architecture using knowledge-brief (A3) type documentation strategies from lean execution environments.}

In model-based systems engineering, stakeholders address their specific concerns by forming a number of views using models. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of automated production systems, a variety of modelling languages, formalisms and tools is typically employed. Nevertheless, the aggregation of models is nowadays limited by the communication between stakeholders and interdisciplinary understanding. Therefore, in order to achieve a positive outcome of the design process it is crucial that the models are free of inconsistencies. As a first step, this paper describes challenges related to managing inconsistencies in models of systems from the domain of automated production systems. A conceptual approach that uses semantic web technologies and a technology demonstrator illustrating the technical viability of the approach are shown. Finally, requirements for a discipline-spanning inconsistency management framework are derived based on the presented challenges and initial findings from applying the approach to a demonstration case.}

abstract = {Changes during the product development process pose a high risk of unexpected high implementation effort. To reduce this risk, the impact of engineering changes have to be estimated in advance before their implementation. However, in large systems, the numerous interdependencies often create challenges to the approximation of the implementation effort by inducing complex interdependencies which are often not easy to identify from the start. This paper therefore proposes a method to quickly determine change efforts of complex systems. To be able to estimate change efforts, the dependencies between system components have to be mapped together with their corresponding modeling effort (e.g. modeling time). The SysML (System Modeling Language) system model is a powerful tool to support this process as it offers the possibility of a very individual and versatile data storage. Furthermore, specific data (e.g. calculation time) can quickly be identified with algorithm such as “metachain navigation”. We propose in this paper to use a SysML system model for an advanced documentation of the product and construction structure to be carried out in parallel to the modeling process of a system simulation model (in this case finite-element- and multi-body-simulation). Assemblies and associated components are represented by the product structure, while the construction structure represents the force flow between two components. Furthermore, in SysML individual data, e.g. modeling time and calculation time, is stored in an instance that is connected to a specific component or assembly. As a demonstration example, the approach is shown on a structural dynamic analysis of a powertrain with seven subassemblies and over 100 components. Following the proposed method, the effort of a specific component change of the powertrain can be estimated quickly due to the stored data in the system model.}

A design mistake can cause - among others - physical damages, high costs or pollution of diverse types.

Research is starting to integrate environmental impacts within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach and particularly within System Modeling Language (SysML) as a tool to foresee design decisions according to previous gained knowledge. Following this, the research holds on existing foundations and proposes to extend current research efforts into a new SysML Assistant to capture the essence of product design and thereby support product development decisions. This paper focuses on the first part of the research, proposing design principles and warnings from requirements via the SysML Assistant. When facing a decision, designers can question the Assistant about examples of what had been designed before in similar or different domains. Depending on the request, designers receive, a formatted object containing several solutions or design principles (requirements, specification, use cases, test cases, warnings) for possible implementation. Various benefits are foreseen with the proposed research. First, a reduced design development time with an increased quality of products in the long term. Second, a reduction of product environmental impacts as well as repeated design mistakes. Third, an incentive to designers competitivity to achieve better design.}

In this paper we describe an extension to the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) that supports modeling of system behavior under failure conditions. This safety annex enables the independent modeling of component failures and allows safety engineers to weave various types of fault behavior into the nominal system model. The accompanying tool support uses model checking to verify safety properties in the presence of faults and comprehensively enumerate all applicable fault combinations leading to failure conditions under quantitative objectives as part of the safety assessment process. The approach allows exploration of the effects of faulty component behavior on system level failure conditions without requiring explicit propagation specifications. It also supports a shared system model, a modeling language that can describe real-time embedded systems, and usable safety analysis artifacts.}

abstract = {The goal of implementing an enterprise digital engineering strategy is to improve data sharing throughout system conceptualization, development, manufacturing, operations, sustainment and their supporting organizations. Data sharing is a critical element of interoperability of models and other digital artifacts supporting the systems engineering process. Achieving interoperability within systems engineering requires eliminating differences of syntax and semantics to take advantage of automation, augmentation, and artificial intelligence capabilities that will increase process efficiency and artifact quality. This paper describes the development of a process-centric Systems Engineering (SE) reference ontology, based upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 Systems and Software Engineering – Life Cycle Processes [1]. The proposed SE reference ontology extends from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is a very small top-level ontology (TLO) designed specifically to support the integration of more specific ontologies that extend from it [2]. A reference ontology is intended to provide a comprehensive representation of the entities in a given domain encapsulating the terminological content of established knowledge. Unlike other systems ontologies, which focus on the target systems, this reference ontology is focused on the systems engineering process, providing context and purpose for the digital artifacts being built and linking the content of artifacts together into one lexicon.}

The skills and know-how of the designers are no longer sufficient and it becomes essential to provide them with efficient methodologies and computational tools to achieve this task. The objective of this paper is to present a model-based system synthesis (MBSS) approach to perform this task. This approach is notably based on the DEPS language and constraint programming. Design examples involving electrochemical energy storage systems are used to illustrate the approach. The design of a starting battery for an internal combustion engine is first presented. It demonstrates the ability to make rational and quantified design choices between several available cell technologies and models (lead–acid, Li-ion NCA, NMC or LFP) while taking into account many design constraints. An example of battery design for a hybrid or electric vehicle is then discussed. The requirements of this second example include in particular a mission profile to be satisfied. Based on these two case studies, the article shows the strength and usefulness of using the DEPS-based design methodology. This approach is particularly suitable for the preliminary design and requirements specification phases, which often require trade-offs between the different stakeholders.}

It represents a hybrid risk assessment ontology, which harmonises basic concepts between dependability, safety and security based on well-known industrial standards. Based on the proposed ontology, we create a cybersecurity risk analysis method, called Security Threat Analysis (STA), for industrial control systems and successfully demonstrate the method. For the demonstration, we introduce a data model for creating a tool-supported data repository for STA, then implement this repository with a commercial-off-the-shelf tool. We use the repository to carry out an exemplary STA of a nuclear fuel pool cooling control system, assessing a cybersecurity-related hazard. The demonstration suggests that the hybrid RAMSS risk assessment ontology and the related STA data model are ready to be tested in industrial use, offering a structured data repository to support assessment and traceability between the created artefacts.}

In the future, it will be more and more beneficial to implement these services and product-based functionality under pertinent aspects of sustainability (e.g. carbon footprint or other critical resources along the product engineering process). In this context, this contribution presents a System of Systems Engineering Lifecycle Concept for the dynamic reconfiguration of systems within a smart Product-based System of Systems to ensure certain sustainability aspects during the system of systems operation using an Internet of Things (IoT) based platform. Part of the concept is, on the one hand, the integration of relevant data from the usage of several systems into the early model-based development phases (like Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE)) by using the so-called IoT-driven smart Product-based System of Systems Reconfiguration Approach to ensure different sustainability aspects in future development phases of a system or a system of systems. To meet compliance and promotion of sustainability aspects in the operation of a smart product-based system of systems, on the other hand, the approach shows under consideration of the current operating data of the participating systems and their corresponding dynamic adaptation using the example of a sustainable autonomous construction site scenario and an appropriate IoT-based platform.}

However, there lacks of platforms in the academic to facilitate research activities in digital twin technologies. This shortage has non-eligible and negative impact not only on advancing digital twin technologies, but also leading to scarcely publicly-available datasets for conducting research. To this end, in this paper, we present Simplexity Testbed. Simplexity Testbed is equipped with a physical model — an indoor ”driving ground” featuring various driving scenarios and surface conditions, and four land rovers (named SiLaRs) of two different types. Most importantly, the digital twin model of Simplexity Testbed currently is an integration of multiple models developed with different modeling paradigms (i.e., SysML enhanced with uncertainty information, Modelica, 3D simulators for autonomous driving), which enables model executions, simulations, and cross-model interactions. The architecture of Simplexity Testbed enables future integration of other modeling paradigms. In the paper, we also share our process of developing Simplexity Testbed and lessons learnt. In addition, we put lights on how various research activities can be enabled with Simplexity Testbed. We consider that with Simplexity Testbed, context-aware, autonomous, and adaptive capabilities of digital twins can be studied, which lead to full-fledged applications of digital twins in industry.}

To progress towards such an environment the open-source OpenMBEE by NASA/JPL is used here as an AST implementation to test its feasibility and demonstrate the collaboration with an AST as part of a pilot study. First results indicate benefits of model-based documents generated with a viewpoint library, supporting collaboration between various stakeholders accessing consistent data without a required modeling background and enabling a more efficient engineering process with faster design iterations. Further findings cover modeling and project management implications. OpenMBEE does show its potential as an extensible and integral element of a collaborative AST environment.}

The proposed FPGA-based security module is developed to mitigate information-gathering attacks, which can be made by gaining physical access to the network, e.g., a man-in-the-middle attack, using a cryptographic process to ensure data confidentiality and integrity and prevent injecting malware or malicious data into the critical digital assets of a nuclear power plant data communication system. A model-based system engineering approach is applied. System requirements analysis and enhanced function flow block diagrams are created and simulated using CORE9 to compare the performance of the current and developed systems. Hardware description language code for encryption and serial communication is developed using Vivado Design Suite 2017.2 as a programming tool to run the system synthesis and implementation for performance simulation and design verification. Simple windows are developed using Java for physical testing and communication between a personal computer and the FPGA.}

The described push towards greater multichannel integration, for example integration of functions or inherent intelligence, leads to a greater experience for the customer. However, it also leads to new chances that intruders such as product pirates or hackers can exploit. For the effective protection of intelligent technical systems, suitable protection measures have to be found. Simultaneously the increasing complexity of the systems leads to the need for new methods to handle the complexity during the development process. To meet this challenge Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is well suited. Suitable measures for a preventive system protection have to be considered already in the model-based systems design. The main goal is the seamless integration of the protection measures in modern methods for an interdisciplinary and holistic systems design. Therefore, the protection measures have to be described as model-based Solution Patterns.}

The scope of the work is to manage the interdependencies of HCD system elements and their integration into DEMO, for a given set of system functions. On the one hand, this means to address the identification and definition of the interfaces occurring, both internally in the HCD system, and between the HCD system and neighboring systems. On the other hand, this implies studying the impact of requirements coming from the ongoing physics studies. The rationale is to provide the technical foreground for supporting the decision-making processes related to the HCD system which is planned to be carried out during the forthcoming Conceptual Design Phase. The results we show in this paper are part of the design and integration activities consisting of both systems engineering methodologies and design analysis, all aiming at ensuring consistency in the overall EU DEMO plant design.

Instead, we rely on heuristics and judgment, e.g., to make process tailoring decisions [3]. Our motivations include identifying core research needs, provoking discussion on key issues and questions [4] and generating interest by applied and theoretical researchers, including from outside engineering. Other authors have noted that SE would benefit from broader research methodologies and methods (e.g., [5], [6]) and greater participation by non-engineering disciplines (e.g., [2], [7]).

A workflow is introduced to guide the change process taking change propagation into account. Second, change impact relationships among requirements, behaviors, and structures of the system model are formalized by an ontology to make the semantics both human-understandable and machine-readable. Reasoning rules are defined as well in order to improve automation of the change process.

We suggest a combination of graph theory, Big Data and Uncertainty Quantification are foundational tools that can model architectures and more importantly the movement of data across architecture interfaces. This provides a mathematical foundation for quantitative architecture, model based systems engineering and simulation environments enabling continuous prototype testing in a model environment. The result is a means to quantitatively validate viable complex architectures early in the lifecycle. This paper describes a graph-based approach to model complex architectures. Complexity will be defined mathematically as a function of the number of entities, inter-entity relationships and active event sequences in the graphical architecture. Uncertainty quantification compares the graph model to the physical System of Systems based on quantities of interest. Big Data facilitates analytics across continuous data threads in the architecture.}

Model-based systems driven product development (or SDPD, for Systems Driven Product Development) has been proposed as a solution based on driving the product lifecycle from the systems requirements and tracing back performance to stakeholders’ needs through a RFLP (Requirement, Functional, Logical, Physical) traceability process. The SDPD framework integrates system behavioral modeling with downstream product design and manufacturing process practices to support the verification/validation of the systems behavior as products progress through all phases of the lifecycle, as well as the optimization of trade-offs decisions by maintaining the cross-product digital twin and thread for global decision optimization in an efficient and effective way. We have developed an innovative digital manufacturing curriculum (designed around the SDPD paradigm) that is based on the digitalization of the SE (Systems Engineering) process through the integration of modelling and simulation continuum, in the form of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), with Product lifecycle management (PLM). At the core of this curriculum is a shift of focus from theory to implementation and practice, through an applied synthesis of engineering fundamentals and systems engineering, that is driven by a state-of-the-art digital innovation platform for product (or system) development consisting of integrated software (digital) tools spanning the complete lifecycle. The curriculum consists of three key components, namely, modelling and simulation continuum, traceability, and digital thread. The curriculum provides a foundation for implementing the digital twin and supports the training of the next generation of engineers for Industry 4.0. The digital manufacturing (or SDPD) framework is applied in the design and optimization of an electric skateboard. The implementation demonstrates: 1) The benefits of digitalization/model-based engineering when developing complex multi-domain products or systems; 2) The ability of students to effectively complete a real-life modern product development within the time line of one semester; 3) The provision of MBSE curriculum for Engineering Education 4.0, characterized by key, integrated skills for the digital enterprise and Industry 4.0.}

abstract = {The 4th Generation of District Heating (4GDH) is a complex agglomeration of heat providers, distributors, and consumers that must be automatically, continuously managed and coordinated. It is a complex system of systems; a definition which we align to Maier's architecting principles for systems-of-systems as collaborative systems. Wrapped in the idea of system of systems is the reality that the 4GDH systems’ descriptions and specifications are not currently all known. Nonetheless, the transition into the 4GDH is actual. We propose the use of two frameworks to secure a smooth metamorphosis and assure systems’ operation, maintenance, and evolution. The two frameworks are the Arrowhead Framework and the OPTi Framework. The first one enables system integration through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the second one offers the overall system optimization with respect to all stakeholders. This paper uses the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tool SysML to model a district heating complex's structures and behaviors from the concept level down to the sensors and actuators within a district heating substation where we apply the SOA technology based on the open Arrowhead Framework. We focus on the Arrowhead Framework's core services, i.e. Service Registry, Authorization and Orchestration to clearly describe the interactions between the different service providers and consumers. Going back up from the sensors to the systems, it is clear that SOA is the architecture that will empower the 4GDH.}

The introduction of new technologies to build ‘More Electric Aircraft’ induces new challenges for both the design and safety analysis of new aircraft. A model-based approach is needed for both design and validation processes in order to manage the complexity and validate the conformance to safety requirements. In this paper, a SysML-based approach merging MBSE and MBSA is presented. This approach is applied to a Flight Control System (FCS) both for the design and the validation processes. A parallel is made to compare the models used in each of these processes. This comparison led to suggestions of improvements both for the design and verification and validation approaches.}

In this paper, we employ a model-based approach to capture and study the chain of events leading to the disappearance of the aircraft. We show that the critical reason for the aircraft’s disappearance was a cyber-physical gap (CPG). The CPG is the difference between the real state of a physical entity and its state as perceived by cybernetic agents. Failure to acknowledge the CPG’s existence, capture it in system models, and incorporate suitable mitigation mechanisms into systems exposed to CPG, has resulted in the past and may result in the future in severe consequences. In the MH-370 case, the plane’s position and adherence to its flight course were misperceived by the air traffic control, resulting in failure to track and find the plane, to this day. Our approach to CPG analysis has been previously shown to assist both designers and users handle emergent situations resulting from CPGs, such as the Three-Mile Island nuclear reactor’s partial meltdown accident in 1979. We propose several mitigation mechanisms, whose integration with air traffic control systems could help prevent similar cases in the future.}

Our proposal is to perform FMEA and FTA analyses as soon as possible in the CPS design process in order to identify and mitigate the risks related to some safety critical structures and behaviours. Thus, these preliminary analyses enable to propose relevant design modifications and improvements such as optional or additional redundancies, components repairability capabilities or relevant control strategies, taking into account the complexity and the potential variability of the structure and the behaviour of the systems. This work derives from previous MBSE (Model-Based System Engineering) and MBSA (Model Based Safety Analysis) integration studies, performed during the early phases of the design of safety critical mechatronic systems, including interconnection components and multi-physical interactions. It relies mainly on M2M (Model to Model) and M2T (Model to Text) transformations and appropriate SysML metamodeling. The proposed CPS safety analysis methodology is illustrated using an aeronautic industrial case study.}

On one hand, the logical interfaces and types are converted to their physical realizations to be used by the subsystem teams.

This chapter discusses how to implement an improvement process to facilitate a smooth and successful transition to SysML. SysML is deployed as part of a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach using the organization's improvement process. Deploying SysML as part of MBSE should consider impacts on the systems engineering process, methods, tools, and training. A successful deployment must be planned, piloted, and incrementally deployed. The success is a key ingredient to motivate other projects to follow. The results should be quantified, where practical, and used as a basis for future improvements. The process includes monitoring and assessing projects to determine issues and improvement goals; developing the improvement plan; defining proposed changes to the process, methods, tools, and training; piloting the approach; and incrementally deploying the improvement. The process should be applied in increments to improve the organization's capability.}

The focus in this work however, lies on the identification of Industry 4.0 potentials on the product considering its interdependencies with the production system. The identification and modelling of interdependencies between product functions, product embodiment with its features, production processes and the production system supports engineers and product developers in a variety of ways. Therefore, a method is developed to evaluate the impact and risk of changes on the product or process side, respectively to the dependent systems or processes. In this contribution, the model PGE - Product Generation Engineering is used to identify Industry 4.0 potentials in the product and production system and to estimate the impact and risk of their implementation. The approaches "Design for Industry 4.0" and “Design with Industry 4.0” are supported with the mentioned method. The occuring information from different domains is modelled and connected with approaches from Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE). This supports the product developer to handle the complexity in a project considering product and production system development in the early stages of development activities. Thus, this paper is a contribution to the inclusion of production systems and industry 4.0 technologies in the product development process.}

However, the modeling must account for entity interactions, system dynamics, and non-functional aspects required for proper device functionality. This paper presents a model-based system architecture that builds upon an extended timed automata-based formal technique. In contrast to prior works that utilized SysML or UML-based models, this allows for the wireless control of bio-analytical instruments. Using this formal method, the UPPAAL tool is used to model and test a case study called “A droplet flow cytometer for testing bacteria’s susceptibility to antibiotics”. The study shows the implications of formal techniques for the design and verification of wireless automation of high-throughput laboratory setups in Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE). Moreover, the paper extends the above aspects by adding the possibility to model multi-system interaction. This is used to analyze the trade-off between centralized and decentralized information flow strategies for better system performance under delay and bandwidth constraints. UPPAAL Stratego is used to analyze strategies for achieving specific delays and bandwidth consumption while avoiding packet losses in the event of network congestion. The results show that under strict delay constraints and high traffic, the use-case system selects the decentralized strategy over the centralized strategy. In low-traffic scenarios, the centralized strategy is more effective at ensuring the reliable operation of systems.}

The motivation of this work is triple: guide the capture of functional requirements, validate these functional requirements through functional simulation, and verify efficiently the consistency of these functional requirements. The proposed approach is decomposed into several steps that are detailed to go from conceptual model of avionics domain to a formal functional model that can be simulated in its operating context. To achieve this work, a subset of SysML has been used as an intermediate modelling language to ensure progressive transformation that can be understood and agreed by system stakeholders. Formal concepts are introduced to ensure theoretical consistency of the approach. In addition, transformation rules are defined and the mappings between concepts of ARP4754A civil aircraft guidelines and SysML are formalized through meta-model. The resulting formalization enables engineers to perform functional simulation of the top-level functional architecture extracted from operational scenarios. Finally, the approach has been tested on an industrial avionics system called the Onboard Maintenance System.}

They can be utilized to model and predict performance and condition degradation throughout a system's life cycle. Condition based maintenance, or the performance of system maintenance based on the subsystem states, is often facilitated by the implementation of digital twins. An open challenge is selecting the subsystems that require digital twins. We establish a generic process for determining a set of priority-based system components requiring digital twin development for condition based maintenance purposes. The priority set, which we term the “triage” set, represents the set of components that when monitored through a digital twin lead to the greatest increase in total system reliability and simultaneously represent the minimal cost set of components for implementing a digital twin. While we focus our process on an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), where we frame the design problem as a multiobjective optimization problem utilizing experimentally determined data and metrics from the model of a real UUV system, the process is generic enough that it could be utilized by any system looking at cost and reliability estimates for leveraging digital twin technology.}

The objective of the approach presented in this contribution is therefore to compare and assess early alternative production system specifications parallel to the development in order to reduce the relevant solution space and save valuable development resources. For that purpose a three stage evaluation procedure is proposed and methodologically founded. Additionally an according multi criteria structure that is based on common specification languages like CONSENS or SysML is presented and the practicality of the approach is demonstrated with an application example.}

To facilitate system design engineers to express their various behavioral requirements, a uniform behavior modeling approach is proposed based on SysML. A set of new constructs are proposed which compose the uniform behavior modeling profile. Based on the profile, the hybrid behavior of the mechatronic system can be uniformly represented in a multi-view and hierarchical way. Moreover, the language- and tool-dependent simulation related information is also described based on SysML as the complement part of the uniform behavior model, which can be transformed to different simulation platforms based on the triple graph grammar (TGG). In this way, the system-level design of the mechatronic system is simulated and verified automatically in the early design stage. Finally, the method is implemented and an example is given to illustrate the whole process.}

This growth in Service has also become a global phenomenon and this has brought much needed attention to Service Science and Service Systems Engineering (SSE). As part of these efforts, this paper proposes the enhancement of existing architectural frameworks for Service Systems. We readily concede that IT is at the heart of Service Systems but we argue existing frameworks need to be expanded to address service systems governance and insertion of technology breakthroughs. A modified NIST framework is illustrated, that includes an Enterprise/Service Management plane to analyze energy Smart Grids as an end-to-end service provider. We also realized the need for integration of tools for the real-time dynamic analysis of ever-changing requirements within a Service System. This concept is illustrated in the form of an internet manufacturing laboratory where design, fabrication, IT, and other supporting tools are integrated to rapidly fabricate complex 3D prototype models. Finally, we discuss issues which need to be addressed for the creation of curricula and professional degree programs in Service Systems Engineering at the graduate level. As a result, we propose a plan for including a Service Systems Engineering specialization track within traditional Systems Engineering programs.}

An essential component is a transformation apparatus that permits diverse models to be integrated independently of their nature (e.g. declarative, analytical and statistical). This paper presents one useful case: the integration of analytical models expressed using the Modelica language. Modelica is an open standard, declarative, multi-domain modeling language that allows for complex dynamic systems to be modeled. Maplesoft's MapleSim is one software tool that supports the Modelica language. The tool-neutral specification for the transformation between the languages Modelica and SysML is defined in the SysML-Modelica transformation specification (SyML) standard published by the Object Management Group (OMG). As part of the development efforts, said specification has been implemented using the Query-View- Transformation Operational (QVTO) language. During the process, several critical changes to the current SyML standard were proposed. Furthermore, a number of current limitations related to MapleSim were identified. Despite these issues, a proof-of- concept transformation was successfully implemented. In conclusion, the integration of complex simulation models conforming to the Modelica language with SysML-based system models has shown great promise and is a highly useful tool to support the decision making process in design.}

This shifts the focus from a component-oriented perspective to a function-oriented view in engineering. At the same time, descriptions of systems and subsystems are required in order to coordinate collaboration with suppliers. These different views on the system under development essentially affect requirements engineering. On the one hand, information have to be provided, e.g., for requirement specifications for single systems. On the other hand, requirements have to be defined for functions realized on different systems and subsystems. This paper presents a concept for model-based requirement engineering supporting to gather and provide requirements needed for different views within the automotive development process. The concept presented is based on five partial models representing the emerging automotive system from an abstract concept (use cases) to a solution (system structure). Each of the partial models, namely use cases, functions, function realization, system structure and product structure are described with regard to required artifacts and their relations based on object-oriented modeling. These artifacts and relations serve for the allocation of requirements or can be specified by existing requirements. The proposed concept support different views upon the vehicle system and allow to generate structured, consistent documents, like requirements specifications for single systems within the development process. At the same time, the impact of changes concerning single requirements, use cases, functions or systems can be analyzed. The application of the proposed concept is highlighted using the example of an electric vehicle.}

This paper examines DM2 with a critical eye toward how it is defined, modeled, and used to support systems engineering. The evaluation is based on a text analysis of systems engineering guidebooks and a comparison with the DM2 definitions. We classify mismatches between the systems engineering guidebooks and DM2 and highlight some omissions in DM2 of important systems engineering concepts. We find that DM2 has some serious omissions that have implications for the ability of DM2 to support systems engineering. We make two recommendations for how DM2 can address these issues. First, the underlying ontology should be developed and modeled using more widespread used tools to facilitate greater understanding, adoption, and acceptance by the community. Second, the ontology must be designed to support the decision processes using language familiar to the intended users.}

Therefore, fundamental design drawbacks might be uncovered too late leading to serious and costly rework. This paper presents a new methodology for the early dependability analysis of a UAV system applicable during the design phase. The proposed dependability analysis is based on the Dual-graph Error Propagation Model (DEPM), a stochastic model of system design aspects that influence error propagation processes: control flow, data flow, and component-level reliability properties. A new domain-specific Systems Modeling Language (SysML) profile and the transformation algorithm from the SysML model to the DEPM are introduced as two key parts of this methodology as well as the main research results of this paper. The relevant technical details of the modeling workflow are demonstrated with a case study UAV that explains how to design a UAV using the introduced SysML profile, transform the SysML model into the DEPM, and evaluate dependability properties.}

Furthermore, the knowledge of the external standards and specifications used in traditional processes are not available to users of system modeling technology, and those who have knowledge of external standards and specifications do not have knowledge of system modeling technology. Moreover, embedding intelligence of external standards and specifications is available within traditional system modeling applications.

abstract = {Customer specific, individual products nowadays lead to larger product variance and shorter time to market. This requires efficient production system planning. In addition, due to a larger system complexity, each iteration of the planning process itself gets soaringly complex. Time constraints and complexity, therefore, emphasize the necessity of supporting humans in planning modern production systems. Especially the determination of the production sequence holds immense potential and tends to get even more complex within specific production technologies. Exemplarily, this article focuses on welding sequences. Here, domain knowledge from product development and production planning needs to be holistically integrated. Furthermore, implicit, historic knowledge needs to be formalized and used in today’s planning tasks. This article introduces a methodical approach and a corresponding toolchain to derive optimal production sequences from customer product data which is validated using welding processes. For this, firstly, a reference system is build up consisting of historic product data (e.g. part list, CAD data) and corresponding production system characteristics (e.g. number and specifications of machines). The main aspect is to use similarities between the new product variant and assemblies from the reference system, to determine implications of product specifications on the process sequence. Overall, such restrictions can be displayed using Model-Based Systems Engineering. Relevant information (e.g. weld seam lengths) can be used to compute the optimal weld seam order regarding minimal cycle times, for example. This requires a parametric encoding of product and production system. In a nutshell, this approach covers the automated derivation of an optimal production sequence for new product variants, based on system information and product similarities, to tackle time constraints and complexity by suggesting initial planning drafts.}

For this, specific challenges arise for the application of MBSE in agile requirements engineering. From observations in agile development practice at a machine tool manufacturer, the challenges for model-based requirements engineering are described and each is assigned to its critical aspect of modeling: The language must formally represent the requirements data model, especially for planning engineering generations. The tool must support collaborative, interdisciplinary cooperation, and consider the dynamics of the requirements model during the development process. The method must individually support the requirements engineering activities, which are carried out several times in a sprint during the development process and must enable a target-oriented process for bundling the requirements into engineering generations. Taking these demands into account, an approach is then presented providing activity-based views in conjunction with activity steps based on a consistent ontology for the description of product requirements and verification activities. The activity steps are composed in activity patterns and support the user in making use of the views for modeling requirements for the engineering generations. The approach is implemented in the software JIRA at a machine tool manufacturer. The subsequent evaluation shows that the approach is used in development practice and offers the potential to plan engineering generation systematically and comprehensibly and to ensure a regular review of the implemented requirements.}

However, electromechanical actuation raises specific issues when being used for safety-critical aerospace applications like flight controls: huge reflected inertia to load, jamming-type failure, and increase of backlash with service due to wear and local dissipation of heat losses for thermal balance. This study proposes an incremental approach for virtual prototyping of EMAs. It is driven by a model-based system engineering process in order to enable simulation-aided design. Best practices supported by Bond graph formalism are suggested to develop a model’s structure efficiently and to make the model ready for use (or extension) by addressing the above mentioned issues. Physical effects are progressively introduced, and the realism of lumped-parameter models is increased step-by-step. In particular, multi-level component models are architected to ensure continuity between engineering activities. The models are implemented in the AMESim simulation environment, and simulation responses are given to illustrate how they can be used for preliminary sizing, control design, thermal balance verification, and faults to failure analysis. The proposed best practices intend to provide engineers with fast, reusable, and efficient means to assess performance virtually and enhance maturity, performance, and robustness.}

abstract = {Verification is a necessary part of Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) which is becoming a mainstream methodology for the design of complex systems. Verification in the early design stage has aroused widespread attention for its efficiency and cost-saving. Although there are numbers of researches on verification, some deficiencies still exist, such as the integration of design and verification needs to improve, the design problems are hard to trace and the behavior verification in the early design stage is often omitted. In this study, a novel ontology-based requirement verification method for complex systems is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems. First, a requirement formalization method is proposed to avoid the ambiguousness of natural language, to make requirements easier to verify, and to make design problems easier to trace. Second, some transformation rules are defined to realize the automatic design ontology and rule generation. Based on these two steps, automated verification can be done through reasoning with ontology models and rules. This verification method is fully integrated with design tools and no additional expertise is needed for designers. To validate its feasibility and advantages, an example of a smart traffic light system is provided.}

abstract = {Digitized enterprise processes often encompass interaction with relational databases. Describing and simulating large-scale and complex processes on different abstraction levels lead to the use of tools and methods of Model-based Systems Engineering. In practice, current entity-relationship modeling approaches solely enable modeling relational database structure without simulation of database interactions at an early development stage. However, in general, it is known that early validation improves common understanding and communication in the development team and reduces the risk of design flaws. This paper presents an approach for model-based enterprise process digitization and a previously developed and now enhanced broker-based SysML Toolbox for integrating real relational databases into SysML simulations. The approach comprises status quo documentation concerning enterprise processes, development of digitized processes and required relational database structures as well as validation of digitized processes using the SysML Toolbox.}

abstract = {The design of a mechatronic system (MTS) is not a trivial task due to the complexity of the systems. The evaluation of various design scenarios for the given requirements of a specific MTS is also difficult. Currently, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and the modeling language SysML provide a novel means for the systematic design of MTSs. However, the specific requirements of MTS behavior modeling, i.e., continuous dynamics or even discrete/continuous hybrid behavior modeling, and automatic simulation and evaluation of the behavior models, are not supported by SysML which intends to create descriptive static design models. Therefore, extension should be made for SysML to support detailed hybrid behavior modeling and the transformation between hybrid models in SysML and executable simulation models in certain simulation environment. For this study, a meta-model based method is proposed to integrate the system design and simulation models of MTSs. First, a set of stereotypes is defined to facilitate the designer to explicitly model hybrid dynamic behavior based on SysML. The necessary simulation information is also formalized in SysML to support an analysis of the system dynamic behavior with the aid of simulations. Finally, the SysML-based system dynamic behavior, and the related simulation information are integrated with the platform-specific simulation model through a bidirectional model transformation approach based on a triple graph grammar (TGG), which facilitates the automatic model consistency and traceability between system design and simulation. The proposed method is implemented and illustrated by using an Inverted Pendulum System (IPS).}

All the while, the agile themes of incremental development and continuous verification of engineering data are emphasized. The stakeholder requirements workflow includes five key activities; Identify Stakeholders, Generate Stakeholder Requirements, Model Stakeholder Use Case Scenarios, Create/Update Validation Plan, and Perform Review. Each of these activities is defined in detail, the workflows are explored, and their agile implementation is explained. In addition, two examples are used in this exploration—a high-end running treadmill and an industrial robot exoskeleton, the “T-Wrecks.” The chapter shows how to identify the stakeholders, elicit their needs, capture those needs as requirements, organize them into use cases, and perform scenario analysis to ensure their completeness, accuracy, and consistency.}

These devices are composed of electrical components. They are likely to be subject to failures that may impact automobile safety, which means the safety of the vehicle occupants or pedestrians. Recent standards like ISO 26262 aim at mitigating these safety problems. Automobile engineers must prove that they perform safety studies along the design process. Meanwhile, they have to cope with other changes in their engineering practices. Due to the goals of verifying the satisfaction of all requirements, the design offices have introduced new practices based on Systems Engineering (SE) which are based on models. SE tools or processes are based on a functional approach of the system in which dysfunctional aspects are missing. Thus, there is a need to integrate the safety domain into the SE framework in order to improve safety studies and the collaboration between systems engineers and safety specialists. This paper analyzes this issue by focusing on the definition of high-level (or vehicle-level) safety requirements. It proposes a Safe Systems Requirement Engineering Process and a method named Operational and System Hazard Analysis (O&SHA) that helps to specify the high-level safety requirements (called safety goals in ISO 26262). It is based on a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach (MBSE) which integrates safety aspects. The added value of the proposed method is illustrated by applying it to two case studies.}

Thus, this contribution deals with the fundamental conception and first implementation of a systematic development methodology covering the disciplines of mechanics, electrics/electronics and software just like the focus on an integrated view on product, production and material aspects. To ensure an application-specific manifestation of the product development process for three exemplary use cases from small and medium-sized enterprises but also large corporations in the area of prosthetics, bike construction and plant engineering, the individually developed methods and tools are first generalized in order to make them adaptable to a wide variety of industries. As a result, one lightweight-specific method or tool (e.g., function mass analysis, “PPM solution correlator“ or “2D layout & weight drafting”) is introduced in more detail for all stages of the technically extended RFL(T)P approach derived from model-based systems engineering (MBSE).}

There are some tools developed to support MBSE in complex system design and modeling. However, none of them has got the functionality of supporting system optimization. This work is precisely motivated by this gap and aims to develop effective methods to support automatic system optimization for MBSE. Specifically, a pattern-based method is proposed to support the integration of system optimization into mechatronic system design. In such a method, optimization problems, their solving methods and computation results are formally defined in each pattern based on the System Modeling Language (SysML). In addition, a model description scheme termed an optimization profile is proposed based on SysML to include the components for formalizing different kinds of optimization problems and optimization methods. After an optimization profile is created for an optimization problem, system optimization methods can be chosen automatically from the pattern library based on a semantic similarity evaluation. Then, optimization results are provided to users to support decision-making and the pattern library is updated using the relevant information obtained in this process. A system design example is used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of proposed methods.}

The necessity of an adaptable and highly efficient production becomes more evident than ever. One contribution to achieve this goal is the research project “Intelligent Modular Robotics and Integrated Production System Design for Aircraft Manufacturing” (iMOD). Namely, it will analyze challenges regarding (1) an integrated and Digital Twin-based system design approach, (2) flexible and modular robotics to support workers with unergonomic tasks and (3) a flexible intralogistics based on Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Those three aspects will be integrated into an approach that uses semantic technologies to connect the different components across different levels of functionality and different life cycle phases.}

One of the first challenges faced is how to represent the SoS in a form that lends itself to detailed analysis, especially when full details of the component systems may not be readily available. Therefore, an important consideration is whether use of model abstractions can be sufficient to deal with many of the analysis needs of the SoS. It is clear there is a need for a new paradigm, encompassing methodology, models, tools and flows that enable the future engineering of SoS in order that they can be operated effectively. This paper describes how we are using architecture patterns to architect and analyze SoS in order that we can compare different architecture solutions and provide guidelines for the development of a future architectures based on the analysis of existing architectures. Insights are given to show the benefits for SoS architecture analysis with exemplars taken from a test case dealing with emergency response for a major incident in the UK. Our findings show the significant increase in SoS characterization that patterns can afford the systems architect in all phases of SoS evolution in order to deliver improved SoS capability.}

Digital Twins (DTs) are an essential part of that system of systems because all relevant assets will need those digital representations to be integrated into such kind of environment, as they establish the required flexibility for formerly rigid structures. This does not begin at the time of delivery of products but already during engineering of the production plant, where relevant data and information are needed. The DT topic is not exclusively a software topic, as it cannot be considered without the associated physical twins. This leads to a need for a holistic Model-Based Systems Engineering approach that integrates all necessary aspects into an architecture for interoperable DTs. This contribution presents an approach and guidelines for modeling DTs based on industry use cases. The goal is to support the implementation of interoperable DTs in Industry 4.0 by using formal modeling techniques. This closes the gap between informal discussions about DTs between value chain partners and the implemented interoperable DTs needed for a specific use case. Compatibility with emerging standards such as the asset administration shell is assured. Focus is the modeling of the DT environment, e.g. a production plant as a system of systems as well as the description of logical DT content elements. Main elements in the environment of a DT are other linked DTs, their relationships and interactions. Users of the modeling approach are developers or management responsible for the company’s DTs. They can use it to develop the correct DTs for relevant use cases of their assets.}

Missing analysis methods as well as missing awareness of the importance are obstacles in decision making. Therefore, a multi-criterial analysis method for handling systems for decision empowerment is presented in this paper. The presented methodology enables the engineer to analyze the suppliers for decision making in the purchasing process as well as the identification of weak points regarding sustainability in the handling systems. The methodology offers the possibility of analyzing a system of several parts as a whole, rather than just individual parts. The methodology is implemented in a usable software prototype which has a graphical interface for the data input and can be connected to conventional databases. The usability of the tool is shown with a handling system consisting of an industrial robot and a gripping system.}

abstract = {In product development, early decisions made within the requirements specification and design phase have significant impact on overall functionality, quality and lifecycle cost of the product. In Systems Engineering, these oftentimes iterative design phases are steered by underlying development models, providing processes, guidelines and best practices. One family of guidelines are the “Design for X” (DfX) tools or principles. In the development of mechatronic systems e.g. production systems, traditionally the mechanical, electric and software domain are to be distinguished. Over time, driven by trends of digitalization, communication and interconnection of systems, the product innovation and thus the required development effort has been shifting from the mechanical domain towards the software domain. The question of system interoperability thereby is of a fundamental nature. This is especially relevant within the current paradigms of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Twin. To reflect the growing importance of interoperability (i.e. the ability of systems to purposefully interchange interpretable information) as a requirement for the product within the design phase of technical systems, this paper introduces “Design for Interoperability” (DfIOp) as a new DfX principle. First, this is motivated by the ever-growing importance of information technology for current and future products. Then, the main contribution of the paper is the combination of the state of the art in the research domains of DfX, interoperability, Systems Engineering and Industry 4.0. Consequently, DfIOp will be presented, including a systematization model as well as a first method for its implementation. Further contemplation on DfIOp shows, that it enables derivative principles such as “Design for Data Analytics” and “Design for Digital Twin”. In future research, the underlying models as well as methods of DfIOp are to be further detailed and integrated into the research context.}
