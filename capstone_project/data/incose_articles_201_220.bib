abstract = {Abstract Data and information are considered today as the “new oil” or the “new gold” in almost all aspects of life and economic domains, such as industry, healthcare, education, entertainment and more. The so-called 4th Industrial Revolution1 is based on the digital transformation derived from the Big Data revolution, through the capability of storing huge amounts of data and performing very sophisticated analytics. In this paper, we present opportunities for Systems Engineering (SE) to evolve towards a data -driven and evidence -based discipline, thereby making better systems and engineering decisions. We discuss how systems engineers can apply data-driven characteristics through systems engineering processes and programs. The classical Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approaches are presented here as powerful tools to collect, generate, and analyze data on systems under development. In addition, the “Digital Twin” concept is presented here in the context of system design. We highlight the challenges for systems engineering to become an evidence-based discipline. Moreover, we empha-size research and development in systems engineering processes using statistical techniques in the design and analysis of systems testing, and Model-Based Systems Engineering (SE) as a source for evidence-based engineering decisions. The success of data driven SE in organizations depends on the information and data analytics infrastructure in these organizations. An information quality frame-work is proposed for evaluating organizational information infrastructure. In addition, it is proposed to assess the data analytics maturity level in organizations. The level of data analytics is the basis for planning implementation programs of data-driven and evidence-based systems engineering. The paper concludes with a case study based on a real-life complex project, and lessons learned for ef-fective data analytics implementation.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper examines in close relation two fields of growing importance: model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and natural language processing (NLP). System models provide a structured description of engineering data, whose inherent semantics often remains hard to explore. Natural language understanding, (i.e., the machine analysis of texts produced by humans) an important field of NLP, focuses on semantic text comprehension but cannot directly account for structured information sources. In this paper, we investigate natural language understanding of MBSE artifacts as they appear in industrial scenarios. In this context, the wide and heterogeneous knowledge space and user base calls for novel techniques to facilitate information retrieval from complex system models. We thus propose to leverage domain-specific text generators to transform models into a descriptive text corpus on which we apply state-of-the-art semantic search and analysis techniques. We illustrate the approach on relevant MBSE examples by performing a qualitative evaluation of intuitive text search and comprehension in textual descriptions obtained from system models.},

The approach applies to distributed and real-time systems. A by-product of the approach is an automated ability to reuse systems specifications and systems designs. A simple example is provided to show how the optimization works. It shows how modeling and automation augment inspired engineering but do not substitute for it.

A new architecture in this application must satisfy demanding requirements in safety, reliability, availability, maintainability, retrofittability, deployment timelines, and interface compatibility. Additionally, the new architecture must be defendable against the industry's decades-long established regulatory, cultural and technological legacies. To objectively design within these constraints, a system model was developed iteratively using both bottom-up and top-down analysis to define a complete functional and physical architecture. Inconsistencies between the functional and physical models encountered are resolved through detailed functional analysis and product realization process. The hybrid bottom-up, top-down approach employed, supports continuous stakeholder validation and requirements verification. The tailored MBSE approach and conceptual functional and physical models are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract Increasing complexity of mechatronic products leads to more challenging designs. As the most important stage, system design determines the overall product architecture. Defects in this stage are difficult to rectify in future stages, thus requiring greater model accuracy. With the development of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), model verification can detect design defects, reduce development costs, improve development efficiency, and ensure system reliability. Currently, conventional verifications are performed only after design processes, which makes it difficult to make systematic modifications. To solve this problem, a model verification method implemented in the design stage is proposed in this study. Using this method, designers are able to detect defects earlier, thereby reducing modification costs. The proposed method is as follows: first, a language named Relation-based Modeling for Static Properties (RMSP) is proposed to formalize the static properties of requirements; second, the representation of “Conceptual Graphs” is extended to meet the needs of model verification of mechatronic products; finally, requirements in RMSP and system design in Systems Modeling Language (SysML) are transformed into the Extension of Conceptual Graphs. In this manner, the incorrectness and inconsistencies between requirements and system design can be found through projection in the system design stage. The omitted or improperly designed requirement items would be found and redesigned to fulfill the product requirements.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices have been gathering momentum for over 20 years and are seen as the future of systems engineering. MBSE formalises the practice of systems engineering through the use of models and its aim is to overcome the limitations inherent in describing complex systems and their development and sustainment using documents. However, certain project practices, in particular the tendering and contracting processes, are still strongly tied to the use of documents. This paper identifies the challenges that need to be addressed to use MBSE across the contractual interface in a competitive tendering environment. The focus is on the transition of models created by the customer (acquirer) during the capability definition phase to the supplier both during the tendering process and through the systems architectural design and development phases. The paper unfolds with a literature survey and then progresses to surface key insights and challenges for the adoption of model-centric acquisition, looking into the past, present and future from the Australian and Norwegian defence perspectives. This is supplemented through case studies involving the utilisation of RDD-100 for model-centric acquisition of Frigates by the Royal Norwegian Navy and through ongoing research by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Organisation, and the Defence and Systems Innovation Centre. The paper concludes with a summary of the achievements to date and the challenges to be addressed in order to enable and foster the widespread adoption of model-centric tendering and equipment acquisition.},

Model-based Systems engineering (MBSE), as a new paradigm of capturing and analyzing knowledge about the system, is one of the core factors to drive this transformation. MBSE practices are more and more widely applied to system-of-systems (including enterprise and mission) engineering, which becomes a crucial part of the successful digital transformation. The core challenge today is how digital continuity can be maintained by connecting system models to system-of-systems models, especially when multiple parties are involved in their creation and exploration.

Digital definition of this information eases configuration management and allows reuse, so that engineers can focus more on the technical challenges of system development and less on the tedium of document management. To ensure the SAM accurately reflects system description, uses consistent terms, and content is not duplicated, the model must be validated.

abstract = {Abstract Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been developing for some time, and has recently acquired new impetus with the completion of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). This paper envisions taking MBSE much further, to a future of highly integrated and automated design and verification coupled with advances in simulation and domain linkage to allow the synthesis of complete systems from requirements into mathematical models and then into physical realizations. This would permit the application of three of the most successful approaches from agile software development, namely rapid, iterative development of the system starting with the highest value functions, facilitating continual reassessment of the future direction, and continual regression testing to ensure that system bugs are identified and removed rapidly. We envisage the requirements and the model evolving together from proto-requirements and proto-model in increasing detail until the point at which the model can be realized with real hardware and software. Taking this further, the MBSE engine can perform trade-offs and optimization on the design. Implementing this vision requires progress in a number of technologies, such as data exchange between domain tools. At this time, much engineering effort is consumed in people communicating and mediating information and translating it from one form to another (e.g. system design to mechanical design). If we can realize the vision proposed, we can remove much of the burden of information mediation and optimization, allowing engineers to focus on their expertise and larger issues. The potential savings in labour are huge.},

Unfortunately, this design approach has inherent weaknesses that do not allow for requirement sets to be both complete and design agnostic, both of which are considered necessary characteristics for good requirement sets. In practice, it is also difficult to design the behavior of complicated systems using functional decomposition since a large portion of the design challenge must be handled up-front. This paper introduces a top-down functional composition methodology approach to behavioral design. The paper argues that the presented methodology does not have the shortcomings associated with functional decomposition and that it also enables early and continuous-, integration of design, test of design and validation of design. Therefore, this approach is more beneficial for engineering design of complicated systems, especially when model based systems engineering (MBSE) is applied.},

MBSE provides a systematic approach to developing executable plans through visualizing the processes; identifying resource limitations and gaps; identifying investment requirements for mitigating and recovery from disasters; and estimating the costs associated with the entire emergency planning, preparedness, and recovery. The scope of this paper includes the policies that have been set forth by domestic and international government and non-governmental organizations that cover the methods of planning and recovering from an event. We will also discuss the benefits of modeling and how to utilize systems engineering methods and tools to allocate resources, identify gaps, itemize cost schedules, develop timelines, and use simulation to aid in the planning process. The proper use of technology and protection of networks during an event allows the planning process to transition smartly into recovery. The background for this paper comes from applying MBSE to disaster management and recovery for the United States (US) government, which resulted in the development of the Assessment of Disaster Readiness Tool (ADRT). ADRT is a strategic concept and framework, which includes a measurable baseline assessment of a designated partner nation's disaster readiness / resiliency level, supported by a strategic disaster management (response) plan (DMP/DRP) for improvement. ADRT is free and can be used by planners worldwide.},

In addition, as the life cycle of such SoS frequently spans across several decades, customer expectations and market conditions will evolve. Systems engineering (SE)/model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and configuration management (CM) need to be ever more closely integrated to appropriately address this situation. CM as a discipline is essential for establishing traceability and controlling baseline evolutions between all the relevant pieces of information resulting from the related system life cycle processes of all constituent systems of such SoS; but for this to work, the scope of CM must be extended both throughout the entire life cycle and across all participating monolithic systems. New frameworks are needed to effectively and efficiently apply CM across SoS arrangements. This paper proposes an ontology-based, federative approach to managing the inherent complexity of CM in the context of SoS, with particular focus on a change management framework for SoS. Examples from a conceptual system that is concerned with the submarine exploration of Enceladus as part of the “Saturn exploration system” are used to demonstrate typical SE/MBSE artifacts and how CM needs to address them across the involved operational and enabling systems.},

Human Engineering practitioners use HPMs to define crew design requirements including the number of operators needed, the benefits of automation, and distribution of member task responsibilities required to operate a system. The application of HPMs throughout the development process helps to influence the system design by integrating with MBSE processes and informing many aspects of system definition and development including performance trades of algorithms, hardware, command and control functions, automation, and the need for situation awareness to monitor the system. In addition to these design benefits, HPMs save development costs and for a described case study reduced costs \$4.3M demonstrating the economic benefits for systems engineering.

abstract = {Abstract Modelling tools and methodologies without concerns about human understanding may not be suitable for communicating with stakeholders, customers, or management. There are many factors that can increase understandability. Using a generic systems engineering modelling language certainly helps but is not always enough. The understandability of modelling can be improved by using better modelling techniques and strategies, which might be part of a coherent methodology with a deliberate emphasis on communicability. The paper describes the application of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to the design of a JPL mission using the Object Oriented System Engineering Method (OOSEM). Complementary formal modelling using the Web ontology language (OWL) has also been investigated. Using only traditional means, under increased demands on productivity and decreased resources, system integration may become high risk, and lifecycle support is expensive and may result in rapidly outdated components. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is showing promise as a solution to this problem in addition to and enhancing more traditional approaches. The space mission systems models represent sciences and technologies including astrophysics, physics, electronics, mechanisms, hardware and software. Representations of system architecture specification, requirements, evaluation of alternative architectures and trade studies, including static simulation of the performance are grouped into views that represent different stakeholder viewpoints. The human understandability of the resulting models and how the modeling process can increase communication and understandability has also been addressed and observations are reported.},

This work aims to establish, through the use of Systems Engineering and specifically throughInformation Models (Model Based Systems Engineering), how the Subsea Production System Design Basis should be optimally developed. The MBSE is integrated in this work by the theory of Transactional Processing, which is implicit in the universal thought process when behavioural models are drafted but seldom explicitly referred to. The current industry practice for developing an SPS design basis is compared to the suggested optimal process. The work constitutes the foundation for the revised Design Basis issuing procedure and the Design Review practice for the Aker Solutions worldwide subsea business. This work is part of a PhD at the Norwegian Technology and Science University.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases. The INCOSE Integrated Systems Engineering Vision 2025 [INCOSE, 2014] describes how future systems engineering tools will facilitate systems engineering practices as part of a fully integrated engineering environment. A shift towards an integrated, digital engineering environment enables rapid transformation of concepts and designs to digitalized virtual prototypes and then to physical prototypes through the application of additive manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printers and the digital twin in operations. This capability enables engineers to rapidly and continually assess and update their designs prior to committing costs to production hardware. Implementing this vision will require an integrated suite of tools, technologies, and standards to support the full systems engineering and product lifecycles from requirements to design to implementation and maintenance. MBSE models are digital and executable, and using an MBSE simulation engine, they can shift risk towards early stages of project development as the asset can be tested before it is built. In operations, IoT technologies enable companies to capture and leverage information about a product's performance during operation – with the potential to dramatically improve existing and future products. Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) solutions combine IoT platform technology with service solutions. This integrated closed loop systems engineering toolset applied to the Oil and Gas Industry will ensure success of the Digital Engineering Journey. This paper will describe this Digital Engineering Journey using a Coal Seam Gas example.},

abstract = {Abstract The systems engineering discipline focuses on managing and coordinating many domains, specialties, and lines of business. It enables the successful creation of new complex systems using rigorous principles and concepts, scientific thinking, technological tools, and management methods. Engineering collaboration occurs when individuals unite in an effort too large or complex for any of them to perform independently. A digital collaborative environment facilitates the sharing, revision, storage, and publication of ideas, documents, and products through digital means. Until recently, efforts to assemble teams to solve the problems of large, complex systems focused primarily on infrastructure: co-locating teams, integrated modeling environments, efforts to connect tools, and model-based systems engineering (MBSE). Today new technologies offer opportunities to bring systems engineering collaboration into a new era, one which is cloud-based, interdisciplinary, secure, and efficient. This paper introduces a framework for understanding the modern digital collaborative environment as well as its current technical limitations.},

abstract = {Abstract Connected vehicles have great potential to benefit society, yet create huge challenges. Vehicles, infrastructure and enterprise activities combine to form massively complex systems of systems (SoSs) that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Security is ill-defined, making it difficult to achieve a consistent, common understanding of security capabilities across the diverse industries that collaborate to develop connected vehicles. Rigorous evaluation is essential for developing strong security assurance cases. This paper contributes a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) ontology that enables integrated evaluation processes in enterprise SoSs. The Evaluation Ontology allows diverse types of evaluation to be captured in a single integrated model. A connected vehicle security story is presented to demonstrate the value of the approach. Benefits include enhanced business intelligence that can provide a quantifiable, reportable level of confidence in security-related processes and technologies. Further work will extend the ontology to develop a customisable suite of enabling patterns for security.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A heavy rail system is a complex system of systems that has specific challenges for asset management. The introduction of modern digital systems into existing rail systems adds further to this complexity. The Asset Standards Authority of Transport for New South Wales in Australia is introducing model-based systems engineering through the use of an architecture framework populated using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), referred to hereafter as the Transport Network Architecture Framework (TNAF). The TNAF is intended initially to be used to act as a structure that will assist procurement through the depiction of the minimum standards to be met when specifying new systems to be acquired and integrated into the network. This article describes how architecture framework tools can be used for management of the various configurations.},
