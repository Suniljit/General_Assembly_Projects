abstract = {Abstract The application of systems engineering within the medical device domain must adapt to its unique challenges such-as the regulatory environment that these devices have to be designed within to ensure patient safety, and the nature of the interactions between the device and the patient. The sheer number of regulations imposed by government agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and various international agencies adds to the complexity of designing these systems. This also presents an opportunity to implement a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach to capture the regulatory environment and map those specialized requirements to components within the system that address those requirements. In this study, we present a model of a reference architecture that can be used as a starting point for the system design of medical devices. Although the state of the model has not been fully matured, this approach offers the potential to more efficiently address the complex regulatory requirements, and reduce the time to design medical devices.},

The completeness and correctness of the design basis is crucial for the successful execution of the project in safety, technical, and commercial terms. This work aims to establish, through systems engineering and through information models (model-based systems engineering (MBSE)), how the SPS design basis should be optimally developed. The MBSE is integrated into this work by the theory of transactional processing, which is implicit in the universal thought process when using behavioral models but seldom explicitly referred to. The current industry practice for developing an SPS design basis is compared to the suggested optimal process. The work constitutes the foundation for the revised design basis issuing procedure and the design review practice for the Aker Solutions worldwide subsea business.

OPM – Object-Process Methodology and SysML – OMG Systems Modeling Language are two state-of-the-art conceptual modeling languages. While both languages aim at the same purpose of providing a means for general-purpose systems engineering, these languages take different approaches in realizing this goal. As each of the languages has its relative strengths and weaknesses, ways to create synergies between them are considered in this work. We propose combining advantages of each language through automatic generation of SysML views from an OPM model. To this end, we developed a new algorithm and software application for implementing the OPM-to-SysML views generation, and evaluated the results through an experiment conducted for this purpose. Our approach can benefit various stakeholders by promoting better system understanding, standardization, and improved interoperability.},

abstract = {Abstract Engineers design mindful of the purpose of a system. So, engineering conceptual definitions of the concept of “system” frequently include the idea of purpose. However, we also use “system” to describe things not human-designed. We might refer to purpose in living systems, as in the immune system, but biologists use “function” to avoid this. What about inanimate natural systems? Do Saturn's rings have a purpose, or function? And what about pathologies, when systems don't work as they “should”? Do all these “systems” terms and concepts serve us well across these different domains, or are some force-fit? Using the language of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Pattern-Based Systems Engineering (PBSE), this paper describes a framework in which “system” and “purpose” emerge at different levels, apply uniformly, naturally, or not at all, and inform. The framework is the Systems of Innovation (SOI) Pattern. Practical benefits include insights into the nature of innovation across these domains, improving ability to perform innovative systems engineering.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The fragility of critical infrastructures and the interdependency of infrastructures such as electric grids, water, wastewater, agriculture and manufacturing supply chains should encourage cost recovery for investments in resilience, not merely system reliability. Most cost recovery standards support investments for safety and reliability, but not resilience. If model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and virtually all other engineering domains can demonstrate greater system protection, adaptability, and recovery (minimizing cascading harms to connected critical infrastructures), regulatory standards should provide cost recovery for investments in resilience. Beyond cost-recovery incentives, systems-of-systems engineers can design facilities for supply component availability, surge production, and other commitments to more robust supply chains. Firms that plan for supply chain disruptions can expand their market shares during and after emergencies, while other firms decline or fail entirely. System designs for greater resiliency may reward firms that overcome system shocks, even when resiliency investments are not automatically priced into goods sold or services delivered.},

Replacing the current common practice of utilizing one or two technical parameters serially to evaluate candidate architectures is a better method that employs a fuller set of technical and programmatic variables in a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) context. Integrated architecture modelling and optimization is performed in a tool-supported MBSE process to identify an optimum architecture solution. This specifically addresses the predesign phases of a system acquisition program where leverage on total program cost is the greatest. We seek to improve the ability to deal with challenges such as management independence, technical diversity, and lack of synchronization across the programs involved in a SoS. This implementation results in a higher quality optimization with a more informed, and traceable selection decision. An example satellite communications SoS case study is used to develop the approach and highlight its utility.},

ICML is based on UML and can potentially be integrated with other systems models in similar forms, e.g., SySML, and with systems of systems models in UPDM or related frameworks. We have designed ICML basing on a preliminary domain analysis on radio signal specifications, with application to space systems. In the analysis, we have specifically considered simple digital and unidirectional signals, and subsequently we have included a method to use ICML for Time-Division Multiplexed signals.

Implementing MBSE for the first time, however, requires a significant investment from the organization that decides to make the move. Further, the project's stakeholders may balk at joining in that investment without clear and certain evidence of significant benefits. This paper proposes an incremental approach to MBSE for an organization in the chemical processing industry. The initial objective of this approach is the production of a virtual piping and instrument diagram (P\&ID). The P\&ID is a diagram that is familiar to engineering teams and stakeholders in process industries. The quality of the resulting model is evaluated using an established framework. To further enhance the effectiveness of the model, system behaviors are animated with software developed to extend the model into a working simulation.},

In addition, the models show how the analysis results of ISO 14971 can be used to develop a system safety assurance case. The activity models explicitly show the iterative and recursive approach to applying risk management at each stage of system development and address the ISO 13485 requirement for process integration.},

abstract = {Abstract As today's Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) become more and more complex they provide both incredible opportunity and risk. Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides organizations a timely opportunity to address the complexities of Cyber Physical Systems. MBSE tools, languages and methods are having a very positive impact but are still in a formative stage and continue to evolve. Moreover, the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has proven to be a significant enabler to advance MBSE methods given its flexibility and expressiveness. Unfortunately the number of people who know SysML well is relatively small. To bring the full power of MBSE to the larger community, system models can be rendered in intuitive forms to support broad understanding of system models. More specifically, Graph Theory has proven to be very effective in the design, analysis, management, and integration of complex systems. Use of Graph Theory and dynamic visualization can help teams gain insights, build intuition and ultimately help speed the innovation process.},

abstract = {Abstract Through successful employment of large scale Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) over many years, The Boeing Company has developed an elaborate data model and associated constraining business rules that form part of its MBSE tool suite specifications. The core elements of this data model and business rule set are presented in this paper as a set of UML 2.0 class diagrams. Advantages inherent in this core data model and business rule set are detailed. These core data model elements and business rules should be applicable to modeling efforts across engineering domains. It is proposed that these core data model elements and business rules be considered for incorporation into an omnibus data model standard and associated constraining business rule standard that reflects the modeling needs of the MBSE community at large. This modeling standard could serve as the basis of an MBSE ontology, as well as the basis of tool suite and data exchange specifications.},
