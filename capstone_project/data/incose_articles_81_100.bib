abstract = {Abstract Increasing complexity in modern systems, as well as cost and schedule constraints, require a new paradigm of Systems Engineering to fulfill stakeholder needs. Challenges facing efficient trade studies include poor tool interoperability, lack of simulation coordination (design parameters), and requirements flow down. A recent trend toward Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) includes flexible architecture definition, program documentation, requirements traceability, and Systems Engineering reuse. As a rapidly evolving practice, MBSE still lacks governing standards and commonly accepted frameworks. This paper proposes a framework for efficient architecture definition using MBSE in conjunction with domain specific simulation to evaluate alternatives. Variant modeling techniques are introduced as an extension to capturing parameterized architecture options. Initial exploration applies such variant modeling techniques to design for adaptability trade study criteria, as a means to evaluate candidate architecture configurations against multiple requirement sets. A general framework is provided, followed with a specific example including a method for designing a trade study, defining candidate architectures, planning simulations to fulfill requirements, and designing a weighted decision analysis to optimize system objectives.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the revolutionary changes of the 21st century in the aerospace industry is the emergence of Additive Layer Manufacturing or 3D printing technology. This is so for a number of reasons. There is virtually no material waste in the production process. Existing aircraft parts of current designs can be produced in less time and for a fraction of the cost, whilst still meeting the ‘form, fit and function’ requirements of those existing parts. Modified parts that are stronger and lighter, but which could not previously be produced with traditional manufacturing methods and tools, can be designed and produced. Going even beyond parts, new designs will increasingly be enabled with larger ALM machines that are capable of printing much larger components, which have most of the traditional parts already integrated. This dramatically reduces manufacturing and assembly times and costs, as well as weight, while increasing the level of functional integration by such components. This paper reports on the application of MBSE for the development and support of a new ALM Plant in the UK. The establishment of this ‘ALM System’ followed years of cutting-edge research activities on laser and electron beam powder bed technologies. The requirements for and the solution architecture of the ALM System were developed using various methods and supporting tools, until the requirements cascade and part of the corresponding system design, down to the level of certain detailed production processes, was modeled in SysML using MagicDraw.},

This relationship can be threatened by lag in adoption and differences in focus between the two worlds. In an effort to help maintain alignment between SE research and practice, a 2-day workshop was held at the University of Alabama in Huntsville on research needs in SE. The workshop was attended by individuals from academia, the Department of Defense, NASA, and the aerospace industry. This paper presents summaries of the discussions that took place, as well as possible research questions informed by the results of the workshop. The workshop consisted of an introductory roundtable and three breakouts sessions focusing on requirements, verification, and validation; configuration and data management; and systems acquisition and design. Several topics emerged as important concepts for future research, and research questions were developed relating to model-based systems engineering (MBSE), requirements, modeling, sociotechnical issues, and education.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Contingency basing presents a planner with numerous design decisions driven by multiple design criteria such as the number of soldiers, base permanency, base location, and other factors. The operational environment of the base is not static either; design requirements change as the mission changes. In this work, we introduce a model-based systems engineering approach to elicit design and operational needs while dealing with the design complexity of constructing a contingency base. The model includes the key facility types that can make a contingency base, interactions between facility types, and required utilities for each facility type. The model elements are kept at an abstract level so the details can be altered as required by the customer needs. Pairing the model with an external analysis tool allows for quick development and testing. Properties of the facility types can be altered either in the model or the analysis tool, and reflected in both. Using the model- based systems engineering concepts of reusability, these elements can be saved and re-used in future base designs allowing for a rapid and adaptable design process. In addition, the sharing of information visually with Object Management Group's Systems Modeling Language™ diagrams enhances the ability to collaborate with nonengineering subject matter experts within the design domain. By graphically showing the conditions and layout of the proposed contingency base, Department of Defense personnel not trained in modeling and simulation were able to interact with the engineering designs and identify gaps in the proposed architecture.},

This research evaluates the benefits of an MBSE modeling and simulation approach over a traditional, non-MBSE approach through modeling and simulation of an orbiting sample Capture and Orient Module (COM) architecture for potential Mars Sample Return (MSR). The COM architecture was modeled, simulated, and evaluated against nominal load power and output data rate requirements to compare the two approaches. A new modeling and simulation-centric V-model was synthesized from existing V-model and modeling and simulation process models to map out the modeling and simulation activities within the context of the system development lifecycle and used as a tool to compare the non-MBSE and MBSE approaches. A three-phase modeling and simulation process consisting of an analysis and modeling phase, computer programming and implementation phase, and experimentation phase was used to model and simulate the COM. The total number of manual and automatic knowledge processed was calculated for both approaches and used to quantify the benefits of the MBSE approach relative to the non-MBSE approach. In the non-MBSE approach, all knowledge elements were manually processed during the modeling and simulation process. In the MBSE approach, 49\% of total knowledge processing was automated. The MBSE approach showed user experience benefits with modeling and simulating the COM robotic space system through providing a higher level of support for automation, reducing the burden of systems engineering tasks, and reducing effort.},

This research presents an approach for systems engineers to integrate system models with human performance modeling for early and more effective system design. Unlike analyses using traditional physics-based models found in most extant MBSE literature, adjusting system parameters for human-based analyses can greatly impact the design of the system itself. Adjusting a human-system parameter can lead to design implications including adjustments to task allocation, process and workflow, and interface design. To demonstrate this, a quantitative case-study approach is used. Starting with a set of Systems Modeling Language (SysML) diagrams, a task analysis is performed to inform an “as is” model of human performance in the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT). An alternative IMPRINT model is created with varying design parameters and utilized to perform a trade study. Through the analysis, constraints and assumptions placed on the human are verified and the results of varying automation estimated. With current design emphasis in MBSE and model-based engineering (MBE), there is great opportunity to emphasize human considerations and integrate human performance analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is an increasingly accepted practice in the Systems Engineering (SE) community, however, little has been done to empirically show that MBSE provides value. Furthermore, as the industry continues in the direction of digital transformation, MBSE will become a critical component of the larger Digital Engineering (DE) approach. This paper presents a measurement framework for selecting and developing appropriate metrics to assess the value/benefits of MBSE and subsequently DE. Utilizing expected benefits identified in a review of MBSE literature, a causal map was hypothesized to show how expected benefits (potential metrics) influence and relate to each other. This was done in order to systematically determine which benefits would be the most impactful to measure. The hypothesized causal model was presented for feedback to subject-matter experts from a working group developing the first DE measurement framework. This group is a joint effort with industry, academia, and the USA government to develop DE metric standards. Once the causal map was finalized, a case study was used to partially validate the causal model. Based on the causal map and subsequent analysis, we can recommend the first metrics to be employed for DE/MBSE based on the most influential nodes of the causal model. The potential metric candidates include: system quality, defects, time, rework, ease of making changes, system understanding, Effort, accessibility of information, collaboration, project methods/processes, and use of DE/MBSE tools. We believe a concerted effort across the industry to focus on measuring these variables is the most effective way to establish proof of the value of MBSE and DE.},

abstract = {Abstract Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an evolving practice in the early stages of adoption similar to the mechanical, electrical and software domains 20 to 30 years ago. Today there is increasing recognition of the potential MBSE brings to system life cycle processes with the increasing complexity of systems and the demands of the global marketplace. In order for the practice to realize this potential, system modeling and MBSE must be part of the larger model based engineering effort, and integrate with other engineering discipline models and modeling activities across the life cycle of a system. This is placing increasing demands on the need for Model Lifecycle Management (MLM) as an essential part of an MBSE infrastructure. This paper establishes the motivation for MLM, as well as laying the foundation for addressing challenges that lay ahead. The paper is focused on describing key concepts, requirements, current practices, and future directions of MLM, and setting the basis for more in depth overview of MLM solutions and vendor offering that are beyond the scope of this paper.},

abstract = {Abstract Requirements are attributed as a common cause of failure in system development. Not only are text requirements ambiguous, the domain conditions under which they are to be satisfied are vague. Until operating conditions and requirements are formally captured, they will continue to be vague with ill-defined verification criteria. SysML used in a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) development process can enable mitigation of this primary source of error. By representing the system under design and its operating environment as a composite SysML model with parametric diagrams, requirements can be formalized in a precise manner. Formalization of requirements and constraints with parametric diagrams enables them to be verified and flowed down during the development process. An example will be used to illustrate how parametric diagrams can be used to develop requirements and constraints.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and other domains, the capability to effectively plan and perform system verification tests is increasingly a strategic differentiator. This paper reports on methods used to improve effectiveness of complex aircraft system tests, the gains achieved, and their connection to underlying methods and trends. These include use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), leveraged by pattern-based systems engineering (PBSE) to generate configurable, reusable system models — the focus of the INCOSE MBSE Patterns Challenge Team (Patterns Challenge Team 2013-2015). Distinctive aspects include (1) use of configurable, model-based patterns of system descriptions, including configurable system verification tests, (2) improved ability of model-based descriptions to integrate modeling tools and automated systems for test management, (3) use of models to describe both the system under development and the development process, and (4) ability of these models to be integrated with other system lifecycle management processes and information systems, for increased leverage.},
