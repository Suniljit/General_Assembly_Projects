However, discussions not occurring, but should be, are the implementation challenges. Issues such as: (i) a comprehensive understanding or the organization's vision and goals for the MBSE environment; (ii) establishing a comprehensive model - the proverbial “single source of technical truth;” (iii) the governance and management of the MBSE environment; (iv) establishing an infrastructure and support environment that allows for collaboration and communication across stakeholders; and, (v) realizing the need, and establishing a plan, for organizational culture change. This paper discusses implementation challenges, associated with those five issues, that must be overcome to transition to a true MBSE environment.

When new projects and systems are under development, there are decisions that need to be made related to the reliability of it that may rise issues and it is essential to be able to reduce and mitigate risks in the early stages before the cost of fixing them increases. As systems continue to grow in scale, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has become the main approach to manage complexity and maintain consistency in system development. MBSE is an approach that is becoming particularly popular because it allows the generation of system models that help formally establish specification, system requirements, analysis, design, and verification and validation (V&V) activities throughout the development of the system life cycle while ensuring traceability. In this paper, a detailed review of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) System design process implementation as a use case is presented using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) to support system semantics through an MBSE approach, and later develop a reliability analysis - Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to help in system improvements and facilitate decision-making in the development of the system.","","978-1-6654-3441-6","10.1109/RASSE53195.2021.9686824","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686824","Stakeholders;Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);system requirements;analysis;design;V&V;ATM;SysML;FTA","Industries;Analytical models;Online banking;Semantics;System improvement;Reliability engineering;Systems Modeling Language","decision making;failure analysis;fault trees;reliability;systems analysis;systems engineering","system improvements;Model-Based Systems Engineering approach;obtain Fault trees;failure Analysis;SysML;ambiguous communication;interested shareholders;main approach;system development;system models;system requirements;system life cycle;Automated Teller Machine System design process implementation;Systems Modeling Language;system semantics;MBSE approach;reliability analysis - Fault Tree Analysis","","","","8","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The early problem definition phase requires an application of systems thinking with adequate modeling tools and methods. Then, the later problem definition phase and early system architecting phase requires transferring the captured problem to systems engineering tools and methods through emerging techniques such as model-based systems engineering (MBSE) using SysML (MBSE is the practice of using a modeling tools to capture systems engineering diagrams). This paper presents a method for capturing a problem through systemigrams and the Boardman soft systems methodology and then directly translating the systemigrams into SysML diagrams. With MBSE increasing in usage, this method could provide a time savings opportunity during model development along with the possibility of lowering information distortion or loss that can occur during transformation of systems thinking to systems engineering activities. This paper includes a case study which demonstrates how the proposed approach was applied on a problem being considered by the U.S. Army-Contingency Basing for Small Combat Units.

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has proven to be effective at managing complexity through the development of systems in a virtual environment. Several languages have been developed in the spirit of MBSE; however, these languages often do not include the full spectrum of information needed for holistic system solutions. The Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML) has been developed to provide extensible language that contains both visualization models and an ontology. When LML is coupled with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), the result is a modeling constructs that better supports systems engineering processes across the entire spectrum of lifecycle concerns. This coupling will not only be beneficial today, but could serve as a catalyst for a future MBSE environment.","","978-1-4673-9519-9","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490581","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Systems Modeling Language (SysML);Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML)","Unified modeling language;Object oriented modeling;Systems Modeling Language;Adaptation models;Ontologies","SysML;systems engineering","model-based systems engineering;lifecycle modeling language;systems engineering community;system lifecycle;virtual environment;holistic system solutions;LML;visualization models;ontology;systems modeling language;SysML;systems engineering processes;MBSE environment","","5","","7","USGov","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In that sense, efforts have been driven to develop Model-Based Systems Engineering tools and methods. Despite recent progress, there are still doubts in terms of the practical use and benefits. The main concerns are related to integration among tools and exchange of information between multidisciplinary artifacts. This paper compares Document-Centric Engineering (CAx tools) and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) in light of Industrial Automation Systems using a real domain. Therefore, a MBSE compliant method was developed and tested. Commercial tools such as the Eclipse platform and the ModelicaML language were used to perform abstract modeling while COMOS® from Siemens® was used to develop the multidisciplinary artifacts for project documentation. A Java application was developed to integrate component information between the selected environments. The OpenModelica Compiler was integrated to the platform to allow system and component behavior simulation. Tests have shown that the tools involved on this investigation still need further development concerning maturity and exchange of information from abstract models down to domain specific models. On the other hand, MBSE has proven to be an important tool to match different team approaches and concerns, improving team communication using conceptual-wide and abstract symbols. Connecting abstract ModelicaML models to a simulation environment using Modelica led to a better understanding of systems behavior prior to realization and provided an analysis environment for early detection of project errors and operational failures.","2375-5261","978-1-4799-4430-9","10.1109/ISORC.2014.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899129","Industrial Systems Engineering; Model-Based Systems Engineering; Modelica; COMOS®","Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Computational modeling;Automation;Mathematical model","Java;manufacturing systems;object-oriented methods;production engineering computing;program compilers;specification languages;systems engineering","model-based systems engineering;domain engineering;industrial automation systems;information exchange;document-centric engineering;MBSE;Eclipse platform;ModelicaML language;COMOS;OpenModelica Compiler;Java application","","9","","19","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lack of system understanding can lead to unidentified (safety relevant) security requirements (SRSR) in early engineering. This can increase product development costs or compromise system safety compliance. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) improves the system understanding by using models. Conducting workshops in the context of MBSE promotes interaction between stakeholders so that confusion regarding SRSR can be resolved already in the workshop. Using the models created, requirements can be derived in the workshop. However, established security & safety approaches are not specifically designed to be used in conjunction with MBSE and requirements engineering. In this paper, we present an extension of our previously developed SAVE approach. This extension supports a team of stakeholders in workshops to derive SRSR using MBSE.

Using a domain-independent language such as the systems modeling language (SysML) to implement MBSE, the holistic approach proposed here effectively introduces a new paradigm in disaster management studies that is aimed at reducing the aforementioned complexity. By enforcing traceability between the DMS subsystems, and by leveraging artifacts such as viewpoints to develop perspectives that are tailored to specific stakeholders and users, it is anticipated that a MBSE-based holistic approach such as the one presented in this paper will promote proper use of the scientific method for the design, verification, validation and improvement of disaster management systems.","","978-1-4244-5884-4","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482340","Model-Based Systems Engineering;natural disaster management;agency management;SysML;system architecture;systems modeling","Systems engineering and theory;Disaster management;Engineering management;Hurricanes;Earthquakes;Hazards;Industrial engineering;Fires;Floods;Modeling","adaptive systems;disasters;large-scale systems;public administration;simulation languages;systems engineering","model based systems engineering approach;complex adaptive systems;domain independent language;disaster management studies;disaster management systems;systems modeling language","","6","","19","IEEE","7 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This helps meet the design requirements and maintain traceability (of design requirements and decisions for satisfying stakeholder's needs). UAS development is driving toward increasing levels of autonomy for unmanned systems. The dynamic, non-deterministic behavior of intelligent autonomous systems presents the testers with a significant challenge. The ability to predict the behavior and evaluate performance of increasingly intelligent systems, especially those that employ vision-based behaviors, is seen as a critical T&E shortfall. To address this challenge, we propose, in this paper, to use a high-fidelity simulation environment. This can significantly aid in the evaluation of UAS behaviors and their perception mechanisms. Such a high-fidelity simulator enables the testes to safely conduct a wide variety of mission scenarios to test an autonomous system by providing truth data to compare with the UAS's perceptions. A major challenge here is to manage the system modeling complexity and maintain traceability of design decisions made at each level of the development to meet stakeholder's needs. In this paper, we follow MBSE methodology and use Systems Modeling Language (SysML - a domain-specific modeling language for systems engineering used to specify, analyze, design, optimize, and verify systems) to establish a systematic framework for designing a T&E tool for UASs and to transform stakeholder's needs into design requirements to maintain traceability.","2472-9647","978-1-7281-5365-0","10.1109/SysCon47679.2020.9275894","National Science Foundation; Air Force Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9275894","Test & Evaluation;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Unmanned Autonomous Systems","Modeling;Tools;Systems engineering and theory;Testing;Autonomous systems;Analytical models;Systems Modeling Language","aerospace computing;autonomous aerial vehicles;formal specification;formal verification;mobile robots;robot vision;systems analysis;systems engineering","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Unmanned Autonomous Systems;design requirements;traceability;UAS development;unmanned systems;nondeterministic behavior;intelligent autonomous systems;increasingly intelligent systems;vision-based behaviors;high-fidelity simulation environment;UAS behaviors;high-fidelity simulator;autonomous system;system modeling complexity;design decisions;Systems Modeling Language;domain-specific modeling language;Test and Evaluation tool","","","","23","IEEE","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Flooding events caused by ARs can create millions of dollars in damages. Identifying probable ARs and early warning of potential flooding events can provide state and local agencies the time to prepare for such events. The Bay Area Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information (AQPI) system links users with varied meteorological data ranging from weather radar observations, short term forecasts (Nowcast), 12-hour forecasts, and coastal inundation modeling data. The range of data types presents an opportunity for proactive responses by the users; however, it also presents the challenge of ensuring the correct data is available to the appropriate user. Through Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Behavioral Analysis, the AQPI team analyzes the appropriate requirements for each of the different types of AQPI users. MBSE behavioral analysis leads to the development of a system that services the broad user community’s needs while giving each user group a specific interface tailored for them. This engineering approach also allows for the separation of the processing and weather model execution from the user interface. This separation allows for development and advancements in processing without being tied to the user interfaces.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447116","MBSE;AQPI;Systems Engineering","Meteorological radar;Conferences;Weather forecasting;Sea measurements;User interfaces;Predictive models;Distance measurement","atmospheric techniques;floods;geophysics computing;meteorological radar;rivers;systems engineering;user interfaces;weather forecasting","Systems Engineering approach;Behavioral responses;atmospheric rivers;United States' west coast;identifying probable ARs;early warning;potential flooding events;local agencies;Bay Area Advanced Quantitative Precipitation Information system;varied meteorological data;weather radar observations;short term forecasts;12-hour forecasts;coastal inundation modeling data;data types;proactive responses;correct data;appropriate user;Model Based Systems Engineering Behavioral Analysis;AQPI team analyzes;AQPI users;MBSE behavioral analysis;broad user community;user group;weather model execution;user interface","","","","7","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Model based systems engineering high level design of a sustainable electric vehicle charging and swapping station using discrete event simulation","O. Ginigeme; A. Fabregas","Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, US; Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, FL, US","2018 Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)","31 May 2018","2018","","","1","6","In line with the spate of technological advances, the transportation industry has also witnessed an increase in the adoption of Electric Vehicles (E.Vs). However, there has been and are still some underlying negating factors to the wide spread acceptance of these electric vehicles; one of note is the unavailability and inaccessibility of adequate charging infrastructure, long charging times, limited driving ranges, costs of the vehicles etc. These and many more characteristics lead to a trend popularly known as ""range anxiety"". One of the major strengths of electric vehicles are their ability to be powered by electric energy via stored chemical energy in rechargeable batteries. Some electric vehicles run solely on batteries (Battery Electric Vehicle - BEVs), while others are a hybrid of the electric vehicles and the internal combustion engines (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles - PHEVs, and Hybrid Electric Vehicles - HEVs). However, since these electric vehicles lean towards reducing atmospheric pollution (Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons etc.) caused by internal combustion engines, it also follows that the means of recharging these electric vehicles should also be geared towards reducing pollution to some degree. Hence, the concept of renewable energy sources powered recharging stations. However, before a lot of resources are committed into building such an infrastructure, a model should be developed which will take into account certain key factors such as storage capacity, type and size of the renewable sources, facility layout, policies and other identified stakeholders requirements which are evaluated and used in trade-off and decision analysis. However, the status-quo involves around a document-centric methodology of system development. This methodology carries with it challenging characteristics such as poor communication of data between and within interested parties, inability to contain complexities inherent in today's projects, stored data becoming prone to damage as a result of storage or usage and sometimes, inaccessibility of data. In line with current systems engineering practice, we propose a model-centric approach of the system development life-cycle, which will negate some of the drawbacks of the document-centric approach. In this work, a two-level approach is proposed: First, the model based systems engineering (MBSE) framework approach is implemented utilizing the systems modeling language (SysML) to formulate and show different views and architecture of the system in question. The objectives of this MBSE approach in addition to offering different views of the model are also to aid in real-time communication and collaboration of designs which links to understanding change configurations and impact, requirements verification, and traceability. In the second approach, a discrete-event simulation (Arena) tool is used as the reference simulation optimization tool for the model's architectural analysis. The discrete-event simulation (DES) models a hypothetical renewable-energy powered charging and swapping station with the objective of maximizing the electric vehicle's throughput (amount of EVs successfully recharging and swapping batteries in the facility). Certain constraints such as the allowable area for the solar panels, operating budget, amount of energy to purchase from the main grid etc., are included to account for a realistic adaptation of the facility, which is in line with the concept of the renewable energy sources powered recharging stations previously mentioned. Statistical analysis are performed on the optimized architectures to evaluate and compare the design configurations based on the stakeholder's requirements. The optimized parameters are then used to verify and validate the requirements. These categorization of events support the application of MBSE and simulation to the early stages of the system life cycle development of the high level design of an electric vehicle charging and swapping station.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-3664-0","10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369606","MBSE;SysML;Discrete-Event Simulation","Batteries;Electric vehicle charging;Throughput;Renewable energy sources;Analytical models;Stakeholders","battery powered vehicles;discrete event simulation;electric vehicle charging;hybrid electric vehicles;optimisation;renewable energy sources;secondary cells;statistical analysis;systems engineering","swapping station;battery electric vehicle;hybrid electric vehicles;sustainable electric vehicle charging;discrete event simulation;BEV;PHEV;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;model based systems engineering;MBSE approach;discrete-event simulation;DES model;hypothetical renewable-energy powered charging;solar panels;operating budget;renewable energy sources;recharging stations;statistical analysis","","","","","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article presents a model-based system engineering (MBSE) methodology for the efficient specification of test rigs for FCCs. A systematic analysis of the prevailing common elements and variability in test rigs is presented. This analysis translates into a generic and reusable specification framework allowing the efficient and effective specification of new test rigs.

In the article, a tailored version of the object-oriented systems engineering method modeling method was used together with systems modeling language. The major steps of the modeling method utilized include define problem, define context level, define technical requirements, define logical level, and define physical level. The modeling method developed for the article may be used as a base for the development of bioanalytical devices.

MBSE empowers the formalism of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation, specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the modeling languages and techniques are heterogeneous, even within the same enterprise system, which leads to difficulties for data interoperability. The discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information exchange among MBSE models more difficult, resulting in considerable information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. Therefore, this article presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects, points, properties, roles, and relationships with extensions (GOPPRRE), providing metamodels that support the various MBSE formalisms across lifecycle stages. In particular, knowledge graph models are developed to support unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover, the GOPPRRE ontologies are used to create the MBSE formalisms in a domain-specific modeling tool, MetaGraph, for evaluating its availability. The results demonstrate that the proposed ontology supports the formal structures and descriptive logic of the systems engineering lifecycle.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2021.3106195","CN National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2020YFB1708100); European Union (EU) H2020(grant numbers:825030); QU4LITY Digital Reality in Zero Defect Manufacturing; InnoSwiss IMPULSE project on Digital Twins; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534721","Formalism;interoperability;knowledge graph;model-based systems engineering;ontology","Modeling;Ontologies;Unified modeling language;Tools;Systems engineering and theory;Semantics;Data models","data structures;formal specification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic networks;systems engineering","data interoperability;data structures;descriptive logic;design ontology;domain-specific modeling tool;enterprise system;formal structures;GOPPRRE ontologies;graphs objects points properties roles and relationships with extensions ontologies;knowledge graph;MBSE formalism;MetaGraph;model-based requirement elicitation;model-based systems engineering formalisms;ontological data integration;system architectures;system development;systems engineering lifecycle;unified model representations","","13","","42","CCBY","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But classical Systems Engineering (SE) issues and concerns driven by stakeholders as product managers or project management closely working together with the systems engineer are neglected. This is critical, as SE is a holistic approach, the mentioned stakeholders definitely gain benefits of the MBSE and they furthermore have the possibility to accelerate MBSE introduction due to budget concerns. Thus, there is a critical need to connect SE activities to the MBSE domain providing more acceptance to the approach. We present a concept to integrate SE and MBSE and exemplarily connect a stakeholder analysis as presentative method for SE and product management issues to the system model.

Small satellites such as CubeSats are challenging to design because they have limited resources, coupled subsystems, and must operate in dynamic environments. Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a key practice to advance systems engineering that can benefit CubeSat missions. MBSE creates a system model that helps integrate other discipline specific engineering models and simulations. The system level model is initiated at the start of a project and evolves throughout development. It provides a cohesive and consistent source of system requirements, design, analysis, and verification. This paper describes an integrated, executable MBSE representation of the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) CubeSat mission. The purpose of the RAX mission is to study the formation of magnetic field-aligned electron density irregularities in the Earth's ionosphere, which are known to disrupt tracking and communication between Earth and orbiting spacecraft. The RAX CubeSat model describes the configuration and properties for various systems and subsystems, and is capable of executing behavior and parametric models for analyzing subsystem functions and states of the spacecraft. It is comprised of a SysML model created with MagicDraw®, a set of analytical models developed in MATLAB®, and a high fidelity space system simulation model created in STK®. ModelCenter was used to integrate the analytical and simulation models. The integrated analyses were linked to the SysML model using MBSE Analyzer, a bridge between SysML tools and ModelCenter. Behavioral models were executed for a representative RAX mission to study energy state and data collection capabilities. This work was undertaken to demonstrate the power, scalability, and utility of MBSE tools and methods that are available to help meet the challenge of designing spacecraft missions of ever-increasing complexity. The RAX CubeSat model will be made available to the academic community for further study and potential extension for more complex missions.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-1622-1","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836317","","Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic properties;Computers","aircraft communication;radio networks;satellite communication","integrated model based systems engineering;CubeSat mission;small satellite missions;dynamic environments;model based systems engineering;specific engineering models;radio aurora explorer;RAX mission;MBSE representation;magnetic field aligned electron density;Earth ionosphere;spacecraft;SysML model;space system simulation model;academic community","","33","","11","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the lack of integrating system development process with cosimulations leads to gaps between them, decreasing the effectiveness and efficiency of system development. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tool-chains have been proposed to facilitate the integration of complex system development and automated verification using a model-based approach. However, due to the lack of formal and structured specifications, development information sharing is difficult for supporting MBSE facilitating automated cosimulations. In order to formalize cosimulation in an MBSE tool-chain, a scenario-based ontology is developed in this paper, using formal web ontology language (OWL). Ontology refers to a specification expressing the cosimulation implementations as well as the development information represented in the models supporting the MBSE. It is illustrated by a case study of a cosimulation based on Simulink. Protocol and resource description framework (RDF) query language (SPARQL) and semantic query-enhanced web rule language queries are proposed for evaluating the ontology's completeness and logic for supporting cosimulations. The result demonstrates that the scenario-based ontology formalizes the information related to automated cosimulation development and configurations while using the proposed MBSE tool-chain.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2911418","China National Ministries(grant numbers:JCKY2014602B007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8734748","Cosimulation;model-based systems engineering (MBSE);ontology design;simulation automation;tool-chain","Ontologies;Tools;Automation;OWL;Data models;Mathematical model","formal specification;formal verification;knowledge representation languages;Linked Data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query languages;semantic Web;systems engineering","design ontology;model-based systems engineering tool-chain;multiphysics models;formal specifications;structured specifications;development information sharing;MBSE tool-chain;scenario-based ontology;automated cosimulation development;system-level verification approach;formal Web ontology;semantic query-enhanced Web rule language queries;OWL;resource description framework query language;RDF;SPARQL;multidomain models","","9","","39","OAPA","11 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MBSE offers approaches that can address issues associated with cost, complexity, and safety. One way that this can be achieved is by performing early functional validation of the high-level spacecraft functional avionics system. The use case discussed in this article focusses on the Biomass model, a systems modeling language-based representation of the Biomass Earth-observation mission. The MBSE approach is used to calculate the required size of the data handling unit onboard the Biomass spacecraft. The functional response of the system in terms of the onboard memory usage throughout the mission is simulated. Traditionally, this level of analysis would not be available at this early stage. The approach aims to replace ad hoc, spreadsheet-based calculations with a formal representation of the system that can be executed, interrogated and quantified. The flexibility of this MBSE approach is demonstrated by applying changes to the Biomass project and assessing the time required to implement these changes in the Biomass model and propagate them through to the results of the simulation. The changes have been made independently of each other and include: changes to the logical architecture, changes to the functional definition, changes to the mission profile, and changes to the requirements.

The user introduces the melody in the form of a MIDI file. The system analyzes the melody, detects the scale, then follows algorithms based on thorough theoretical and harmonic studies, to finally generate the arrangement based on the selected music genre (classical, jazz, pop, etc.). Compared to other existing systems in the market, the developed system largely reduces the dissonance between the melody and the arrangement, which makes the final arrangement a good accompaniment to the melody.","","978-1-56555-375-0","10.23919/ANNSIM52504.2021.9552105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552105","model-based systems engineering (MBSE);automated music arranger;music generation;BPMN;MIDI parsing","Technological innovation;Harmonic analysis;Modeling","music;systems engineering","MBSE approach;complex multicomponent arrangement system;automated music arrangement;melody;system analyzes;harmonic studies;selected music genre;model based systems engineering approach;engineering domains;artistic visions;cross domain capitalization","","1","","17","","5 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of development requires a high degree of collaboration, communication, and orchestration. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) supports engineers in the interdisciplinary development of future systems. MBSE uses models to generate a unified and complete view of the system. This allows changes to be easily tracked and the visualization helps to understand the system discipline-independent. The creation of these models still requires high effort. New AI technologies can be used to derive potential assistant systems in the context of MBSE. This paper shows realized examples of AI-based assistance systems.

Both descriptive and analytical models are linked together to enable system designers the ability to rapidly run a wide range of system configurations such that the results can be visualized, analyzed, and pruned to meet system safety and performance requirements. This integrated system approach is more effective than typical standalone or disparate analysis since it enables system designers the ability to consider multivariate scenarios in the system simulation as compared to only a few.

Both have to be integrated immediately into the development procedure. When models are not maintained up to date and not used by different stakeholders, the benefits of the model-based approach are lessened due to the effort for generation and maintenance. The five development capabilities of MBSE, comprising Systems Environment Analytics (SEA), Systems Definition and Derivation (SDD), Systems Interaction Modeling (SIM), Systems Lifecycle Engineering (SLE) and the MBSE Capability and Maturation Matrix (CMM) address this topic on a capability level.In this article, the authors point out the interaction between these development capabilities on the example of a Pedestrian Emergency Braking System (PEBS) development in automotive industry, with a focus on sensor models.

Those increasing demands as well as today’s product development context of distributed interdisciplinary development teams lead to an increasing complexity of systems as well as their respective development processes. MBSE - Model-Based Systems Engineering is regarded as a promising approach to cope with this complexity. MBSE aims at supporting during the whole product lifecycle in system analysis, requirements management, design as well as verification and validation. Especially validation plays a central role in product development as it is the only activity that can ensure customer satisfaction and thus a successful product on the market. However, comprehensive MBSE-approaches to support validation in product development seem to be missing. This paper describes such a MBSE approach to support validation in product development. The approach includes an ontology of terms and their interrelations in the context of validation. The ontology is used to construct viewpoints, views and a modeling framework to structure a system model in the understanding of MBSE. In addition, a modeling method interacting with the constructed views is developed and presented. The presented approach aims at enabling a continuous validation concept, starting in the early phase of PGE - Product Generation Engineering and continuing throughout the entire lifecycle. Furthermore, the approach should support in integrating the development of products and appropriate validation systems, creating a consistent traceability of information throughout the created models. Finally, a specific focus of the approach lies on usability in order to guarantee individual and organizational acceptance. This acceptance is of particular importance to realize a human centered development as it is envisioned in approaches such as ASE - Advanced Systems Engineering.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-3168-2","10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582475","MBSE;Validation;Continuous Validation Concept;Modeling Framework;PGE;Product Generation Engineering","Requirements management;Green products;Customer satisfaction;Ontologies;Product development;Complexity theory;Safety","customer satisfaction;ontologies (artificial intelligence);product development;production engineering computing;systems analysis;systems engineering","Model-Based Systems Engineering approach;PGE - Product Generation Engineering;safety;environmental sustainability;nowadays product development processes;product development context;distributed interdisciplinary development teams;respective development processes;MBSE - Model;product lifecycle;system analysis;successful product;comprehensive MBSE-approaches;MBSE approach;system model;modeling method interacting;approach aims;continuous validation concept;appropriate validation systems;human centered development;ASE - Advanced Systems Engineering","","1","","33","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A lifecycle toolset is described which fuses systems and software modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities, modular open system architectures (MOSA), and device and sensor integration techniques into a single package to enable rapid design, development, verification, certification, and deployment of interoperable, platform portable, embedded mission-critical safety-critical avionic systems. TES' MBSE lifecycle toolset, AWESUM™, supports system architecture and virtual integration (SAVI) of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets, and evaluation of these platform assets through simulated mission rehearsals in a network-centric collaborative virtual environment. The result is improved systems product. The toolset has been demonstrated to several aviation-focused communities including the American Helicopter Society International (AHS), the Association of Old Crows (AOC), the FACE Consortium, and the US Army's Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), with favorable response. TES demonstrated a virtual simulation of realistically modeled and simulated multiple dissimilar aircraft platform systems conducting network centric operations (NCO). With the goal of improving flight-safety and enhancing the situational awareness (SA) of the battle-space, virtual missions were executed showing the inter-operations of cyber-physical system (CPS) assets and capabilities from reusable FACE-aligned applications. The simulated battle-space was composed of device-configured simulated flight models of both manned and unmanned rotorcraft platforms operating within a virtual environment of real-world terrain data. The environment included simulated threats and obstacles used to stimulate platform devices that report detections and produce alerts for own-ship flight mishap avoidance. These detections were then packaged into communications messages (VMF) and shared off-platform via NCO to the common operating picture (COP) to enhance the SA operations of the battle space flight group. After a decade of development and use supporting US Army military common software programs for the PM-AME and AMRDEC, TES is now making its industry-unique approach and model-based airworthy systems/software lifecycle product line available to industry. The MBSE lifecycle toolset product suite, referred to as AWESUM™ for AirWorthy Engineering Systems Unified Modeling, is a comprehensive model-based environment aligned to DO-178C, DO-331, AC 20-148, AR 7062, and FACE™. The AWESUM™ tool suite is currently supporting the US Army's Joint Common Architecture project, a model-based avionics architecture for the Joint Multi-Role family of future vertical lift platforms, and two other FACE-aligned US Army Aviation programs within the military communications and aircraft survivability domains. This is TES-SAVi's first publication and presentation to the IEEE.

This paper suggests a methodology developed to ensure a consistency between the system architecture and models of physics simulation. This methodology creates a bridge between MBSE and physical simulation discipline by implementing an additional diagram/viewpoint on the ARCADIA method. This viewpoint will specify the models, organize model building and give stakeholders a common document on which they can exchange.

Anticipating the RAMS analysis at the concept design helps the designer in the tradeoff of the system architecture and technologies, reduces the cost of product development and the time to market. This action is rather difficult, because the RAMS analysis deals with the hazard assessment of system components, whose abstraction at concept level is never simple. Therefore, to integrate the system design and RAMS assessment, a clear path to follow is required. This article investigates how the model-based systems engineering supports this task and drives the system reliability allocation, through the functional and dysfunctional analyses. The implementation of the proposed approach needs to set up the tool chain. In the industrial context, it must be compatible with practices, standards, and tools currently used in product development. Defining a suitable process of integration of tools used for the system design and the safety engineering is a need of the industry.

This approach could be applied to other satellite development efforts but the emphasis here is on CubeSats because of their historically high mission failure rate and the rapid growth in the number of these missions over the last few years. In addition, this approach complements the International Council on Systems Engineering's (INCOSE) Space Systems Working Group's (SSWG) efforts to develop a CubeSat Reference Model. This approach provides a repeatable, generalized method for CubeSat development teams to follow that incorporates standard systems engineering practices such as: a top-down approach, requirements analysis, use case development, and functional analysis. This effort uses a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. Some of the benefits of using an MBSE approach over a traditional document-based approach are: enhanced communications, reduced development risk, improved quality, and enhanced knowledge transfer [1]. Systems engineering artifacts produced using this approach, such as definitions of the mission domain elements, requirements, use cases, and activities, are captured in a system model which serves as a single-source-of-truth for members of the CubeSat development team. Examples are provided throughout the paper which illustrates the application of this approach to a CubeSat development effort. Since most space missions are concerned with the generation or flow of information, the examples focus on requirements to collect and distribute mission data ending with a definition of the required system functionality to satisfy those requirements.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943865","","Systems Modeling Language;Analytical models;Object oriented modeling;Standards;Space missions","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;software architecture;SysML;systems engineering","space missions;improved quality;enhanced communications;reduced development risk;enhanced knowledge transfer;document-based approach;functional analysis;use case development;requirements analysis;top-down approach;repeatable generalized method;CubeSat reference model;INCOSE SSWG;International Council on Systems Engineering Space Systems Working Group;mission failure rate;satellite development;OMG SysML;object management group Systems Modeling Language;activity hierarchy;functional architecture;CubeSat behavior;MBSE approach;model-based systems engineering approach","","16","","17","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One part sees the advantage in development and project planning. The other part argues that the employment of SysML results in unnecessary additional work. The description of systems is still largely managed by the widely-used Microsoft Office software like Excel or PowerPoint. Indeed, this software has its limitations, especially when it comes to complex systems. Regarding SysML, the aim of this publication is to show the practical benefit and to open a further field of application. The cyclic coupling of SysML with a calculation software enables periodic data exchange in a flexible toolchain. This is a fundamental step, which leads to a new approach of systems development and domain collaboration. The SysML tool is intended to be the highest instance in the toolchain. A calculation software translates all the instructions coming from the highest instance into physical behavior, which can be simultaneously displayed with the aid of a visualization tool. As a significant result, an early validation of the behavior of a system under development can be performed with the aid of the overall model. In order to demonstrate this concept, a high-level simulation of a ""Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)"" serves as an example. Tests show that the SysML controlled TCAS simulation is a proper application to demonstrate the execution of important decisions. By means of the visualization, the TCAS behavior becomes transparent. The advantages of the dynamic co-simulation are particularly in the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to heterogeneous complex systems.","","978-1-4673-9519-9","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490534","Dynamic Co-Simulation;Early Validation;Heterogeneous Complex Systems;Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Systems Modeling Language (SysML);Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS);Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)","Mathematical model;Atmospheric modeling;MATLAB;Aircraft","collision avoidance;digital simulation;road safety;SysML;systems engineering;traffic information systems","systems engineering approach;Matlab;Systems Modeling Language;project planning;complex systems;periodic data exchange;system development;domain collaboration;SysML tool;toolchain;physical behavior;visualization tool;high-level simulation;traffic alert-and-collision avoidance system;SysML-controlled TCAS simulation;dynamic co-simulation;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;heterogeneous complex systems","","3","","9","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital twins vary in complexity and are used for managing the performance, health, and status of a physical system by virtualizing it. The creation of digital twins enabled by Modelbased Systems Engineering (MBSE) has aided in increasing system interconnectivity and simplifying the system optimization process. More specifically, the combination of MBSE languages, tools, and methods has served as a starting point in developing digital twins. This article discusses how MBSE has previously facilitated the development of digital twins across various domains, emphasizing both the benefits and disadvantages of adopting an MBSE enabled digital twin creation. Further, the article expands on how various levels of digital twins were generated via the use of MBSE.

It is shown how system requirements are generated from use cases, environmental influences, failure conditions and stakeholder requirements, which finally result in the system architecture and shows how these work products are managed, especially when people from different domains are involved. Based on this, the domain-specific work products are generated, resulting in a list of hardware components, a software architecture and technical drawings for production.

Development artifacts have to be reconciled and traceability between E/E systems and their components has to be ensured to avoid errors, incompatibilities, and high coordination effort. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) starts early in the development process by defining formal models which link and trace all system elements. However, there still is a gap between MBSE and later product data and lifecycle management (PDM/PLM) because these disciplines have different meta models.

The framework uses MBSE tools to define the complex system architecture and modern internet state transfer and structured data format standards to integrate natural language descriptions, datasets, and models. These can constitute a knowledge architecture that can be used as a long-term research tool. The long-term goal is a framework that captures conceptual models of the complex system, data sets and relationships, dynamic models and simulations, and decision analytics within a common environment. This paper presents a scenario in which we evaluate links between transformations of complex natural gas systems and analyze political intervention into the Russian-European natural gas markets. In this example, we specifically examine geographical, physical (cross-border infrastructure), and commercial value streams through the prism of network analyses. This is one context of a more general model of international gas relationships and flows at multiple levels. The resulting framework provides insight into dynamic behaviors at multiple levels of the system, such as the emergence of infrastructure network and intricate relationships of strong corporate ties and knowledge networks, along with possible strategies for political and economic intervention. The primary goal of an MBSE approach is to capture interrelationships in the complex system at varying levels of abstraction, which enables a common reference for diverse models and datasets.","","978-1-4673-9519-9","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490546","Multi-level modeling;Sociotechnical systems;Complex adaptive systems;Systemigram;Soft systems;Model-based Systems Engineering;Emergence;Emergent patterns;Social Network Analysis;Visualizations;Energy;Natural gas;Emergent patterns;Resilience","Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Data models;Complex systems;Adaptation models;Computational modeling","international trade;knowledge management;natural gas technology;politics;systems engineering","political decision analysis;trade decision analysis;international gas markets;model-based systems engineering framework;MBSE approach;complex adaptive system;complex system architecture;Internet state transfer;structured data format standards;natural language descriptions;dynamic models;complex natural gas systems;political intervention analysis;Russian-European natural gas markets;geographical value stream;physical value stream;commercial value streams;cross-border infrastructure;network analysis;dynamic behaviors;corporate ties;knowledge networks","","1","","16","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both an MBSE approach and non-MBSE approach were applied to architecting an orbiting sample Capture and Orient Module (COM) system concept for a Capture, Containment, and Return System (CCRS) payload concept for Mars Sample Return (MSR). These approaches were applied in parallel to provide a side-by-side comparison of the approaches. The approaches were analyzed using design structure matrices (DSM) and evaluated based on the amount of information transferred between process tasks manually (e.g., elements physically typed into text boxes in a presentation slide) vs automatically (e.g., elements automatically filled out within a block in a model view due to explicitly defined element associations). A total of 4,819 information element transfers were traced in DSMs and used to quantitatively compare the two approaches. The non-MBSE approach required manual transfer for all 4,819 information elements. The MBSE approach required manual transfer for 4,189 information elements and automatic transfer for 630 information elements, providing a minor increase in the automation of information transfer relative to the non-MBSE approach. By incorporating the use of additional MBSE artifacts into the trade study and peer review tasks, manual transfer could potentially be reduced to 931 information elements, and automatic transfer increased to 3,888 information elements.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3096468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9493751","Model-based systems engineering (MBSE);robotic space systems;systems architecture;systems engineering processes","Modeling;Systems engineering and theory;Robots;NASA;Space vehicles;Computer architecture;Task analysis","information retrieval;Mars;matrix algebra;space vehicles;systems engineering","Orient Module system concept;Return System;element associations;4 information element transfers;819 information element transfers;nonMBSE approach;manual transfer;4 information elements;819 information elements;MBSE approach;189 information elements;automatic transfer;630 information elements;additional MBSE artifacts;931 information elements;3 information elements;888 information elements;traditional systems engineering approach;robotic space system;automatic information transfer;model-based systems engineering approach","","2","","45","CCBY","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the complexity of CPS increases, it becomes more challenging to efficiently formalize the integrated multidomain views with flexible automated verification across the entire lifecycle. This article illustrates a model-based systems engineering tool-chain to support CPS development with an emphasis on automated parameter value selection for co-simulation. First, a domain-specific modeling approach is introduced to support the formalizations of CPS artifacts, development processes, and simulation configurations. The domain-specific models are used as the basis to generate a Web-based process management system for automated parameter value selections, which coordinates Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration services of development information and technical resources (models, data, and tools) in order to support automated co-simulation. The services are deployed by a service orchestrator based on a decision-making algorithm for parameter value selection. Finally, developers make use of the WPMS to implement simulations and to select system parameter values for co-simulation automatically. The approach is illustrated by a case study on auto-braking system development and we evaluate the efficiency of this tool-chain by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The results show that parameter values are selected more efficiently and effectively when implementing co-simulations using our tool-chain.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2020.3048821","CN National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2020YFB1708100); EU H2020 Project(grant numbers:825030); QU4LITY Digital Reality in Zero Defect Manufacturing; InnoSwiss IMPULSE Project on Digital Twins; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328223","Automated parameter value selection;cyber-physical systems (CPSs);model-based systems engineering (MBSE)","Artificial intelligence;Decision making;Modeling;Tools;Data models;Unified modeling language;Stakeholders","decision making;formal specification;Internet;systems engineering;Web services","automated parameter value selection;system parameter values;auto-braking system development;model-based systems engineering tool-chain;cyber-physical systems;heterogeneous systems;process sensor data;flexible automated verification;CPS development;domain-specific models;Web-based process management system;lifecycle collaboration services;development information;automated cosimulation","","9","","44","CCBY","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An ontological approach is proposed, as it enhances the capabilities of component model libraries that are already being constructed for use in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) programs. By defining a common vocabulary across multiple design domains, an ontology is capable of driving information consistency and reducing errors that occur due to misinterpretation of common vernacular. Within an ontology, a functional decomposition of any complex system can be represented as a hierarchy of ""classes"", where a class defines any concept within a given domain. The functions that each system must perform, along with the system components that achieve each function and the design alternatives for each component, are related to the system as properties of the system. This functional decomposition structure of the ontology may be identical to the decomposition that is used in an IRMA, which can use information exported from the ontology to perform design space refinement during conceptual design. The result of this study is a process which is capable of extracting information from an ontology, organizing it, and importing it directly to an IRMA which is fully functional and ready to be used. Such a process becomes a powerful capability when similar systems are designed, as the process can be reused, serving as a starting point for concept selection in conceptual design, resulting in reductions in both development time and cost.","","978-1-4673-9519-9","10.1109/SYSCON.2016.7490579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490579","better buying power;cyber-physical systems;model-based systems engineering;ontology","Ontologies;Solid modeling;Libraries;Complex systems;Computational modeling","ontologies (artificial intelligence);systems engineering","semantic design space refinement;model-based systems engineering;ontology;model library;conceptual design;interactive reconfigurable matrix of alternatives;IRMA;component model libraries;MBSE programs;vocabulary;multiple design domains;information consistency;complex system;functional decomposition structure","","8","","18","IEEE","16 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new trend, resulting from the emergence of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), offers new automation possibilities by interconnecting all system components with each other. However, as those components, mainly known as Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) are usually systems themselves, the complexity of such a manufacturing system continously rises, which even has to be classified as a complex System of Systems (SoS). Having recognized the issue of the upcoming difficulties when engineering such a system, several German institutes introduced the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), a three-dimensional framework that offers standards or methods for developing system architectures on basis of different views. Nevertheless, at the current point of view, this approach though looks good on paper, but almost none practical applications are existing yet. Thus, this paper focuses on the model-based development of system architectures according to the specifications of RAMI 4.0 in order to evaluate the practical applicability of this reference architecture for usage in actual industrial projects. This is done by utilizing two actual industrial case studies, whose models are created with the help of a specifically designed software tool, the so-called RAMI Toolbox. Based on the outcome of this work, the usage of RAMI 4.0 for application in the industrial area could be sustainably consolidated.","1946-0759","978-1-7281-8956-7","10.1109/ETFA46521.2020.9211892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9211892","System Architecture;Use Case Evaluation;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE)","Industries;Systems architecture;Computer architecture;Production;Market research;Modeling;Software tools","cyber-physical systems;Internet;manufacturing industries;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;software tools;systems engineering;systems of systems;value engineering","Industrial applications;RAMI 4.0;model based systems engineering;production line;complex value creation networks;system components;cyber-physical systems;manufacturing system;complex System;system architectures;model-based development;actual industrial projects;RAMI Toolbox;industrial area;Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0","","2","","13","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is an emerging field, which applies a model-based framework to the elements of a system comprised of requirements, system functions, analysis results, validation and verification artifacts. The effective comprehension of a complex system is more easily visualized through a model-based approach than a document centric one. The representative models and the inherent traceability which one receives through visual associations provides more effective requirements traceability and analysis; and, thus leading to fewer technical risks, earlier detection and resolution of issues, and helps keep schedules and costs in check. This approach yields better, clearer, and more concise requirements and in turn aids in more effective verification and validation processes as well as more expedient impact analyses of unforeseen changes. This paper describes MBSE through SysML (System Modelling Language) by application on a complex aerospace system. The study qualitatively and quantitatively discusses the value addition of such an implementation using commercially available tools that equip SysML to achieve MBSE in systems. SysML is a domain-specific modeling language developed for systems engineering to specify, analyze, design, optimize, and verify systems. From a practitioner's standpoint, this MBSE approach can be used to engineer any complex system from satellite programs to transport networks.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-9825-5","10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256589","MBSE;SysML;Traceability;Verification;Validation;Requirements Engineering;Requirements Management","Modeling;Systems engineering and theory;Stakeholders;Requirements engineering;Analytical models;Aerospace engineering;Technological innovation","aerospace computing;formal specification;formal verification;specification languages;systems analysis;systems engineering","aerospace system requirements management;model based systems engineering;MBSE approach;domain-specific modeling language;System Modelling Language;requirements traceability","","1","","10","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes two variant modeling patterns which, when used in the right context, can reduce complexity, eliminate many opportunities for error, and minimize development costs and maintenance effort. The 150% pattern, already commonly used in industry, capitalizes on commonality among variants. The encapsulation pattern promotes model organization and understandability. This article also introduces four comparison criteria-number of variation points, number of shared model elements, human readability, and model maintainability-that a system architect can use to determine which pattern is best suited to model a certain product family. The 150% pattern is found to be best to be used for product lines with high commonality among variants, whereas product lines whose variants exhibit much variety and are managed by multiple development teams are best modeled using the encapsulation pattern. A parking brake product family is used to illustrate each modeling pattern and provides a sample context against which to use the comparison criteria.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2939246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863118","Activity modeling;behavior modeling;model-based systems engineering (MBSE);modeling best practices;modeling patterns;product line engineering;variant modeling","Brakes;Object oriented modeling;Best practices;Context modeling;Mechanical cables","brakes;product development;systems engineering","shared model elements;model maintainability;system architect;product lines;high commonality;multiple development teams;encapsulation pattern;parking brake product family;modeling pattern;model-based systems engineering;product line development practices;development costs;complex system models;variant modeling patterns;maintenance effort;model organization;understandability;comparison criteria;best practice patterns;error-prone models","","7","","23","IEEE","8 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is due to the numerous disciplines involved in the enhancements of MBSE - only recently there had been efforts to create new MBSE approaches and even languages. We state that similar to classical Systems Engineering there will not be one specific MBSE - current trends in product engineering as well as literature support this thesis.

The method supports validating safety aspects of stakeholder needs through use cases, scenarios, functions, and components. Possibilities for automated generation and parameterization of test cases are presented. In order to validate the automated driving functions regarding safety, the IPEK-X-in-the-Loop approach for distributed validation environments is used.

What does exist treats the topic in a general manner and is void of details. Given the vital role that technical measurement plays in the systems engineering process, and the ever increasing adoption of the MBSE approach, there is a growing need to define how technical measurement would be implemented as part of a MBSE approach. The purpose of this paper is to address that need. Technical measurement is defined as the set of measurement activities used to provide insight into the progress made in the definition and development of the technical solution and the associated risks and issues [1]. Technical measures are used to: determine if the technical solution will meet stakeholder needs, provide early indications if the development effort is not progressing as needed to meet key milestones, predict the likelihood of the delivered solution to meet performance requirements, monitor high risk items, and assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation actions. MBSE is defined as the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases [2]. The benefits of using an MBSE approach over a traditional document-based systems engineering approach are: enhanced communications, reduced development risk, improved quality, and enhanced knowledge transfer. This paper defines a MBSE approach for technical measurement that begins with a set of mission objectives derived from stakeholder concerns. The objectives and concerns are represented as elements captured in the system model. Next, Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) are derived from the mission objectives. Initially, these MOEs are captured in a special model element that allows for the MOEs to be described in a natural language format that stakeholders will understand. Those initial MOEs are then quantified and captured as value properties of the Enterprise block. The MOEs are traced back to their originating source in the mission objectives. Next, Measures of Performance (MOPs) are derived from the enterprise-level MOEs and captured as value properties of the System block. The derivation of the MOPs is captured through the development of constraint blocks and parametric diagrams. This provides for traceability between MOPs and MOEs and supports performance analysis of the MOPs to predict if the MOEs will be met. MOPs are also traced to system requirements captured in the system model. Next, the process steps at the system-level are repeated at the subsystem-level to derive Technical Performance Measures (TPMs). These TPMs are traced back to MOPs and subsystem requirements in the same manner as described for MOPs. Examples are provided throughout the paper which illustrate the application of this approach to a CubeSat. Using a CubeSat example is appropriate given the historically high failure rate and rapid growth of these missions and the role technical measurement could play in increasing their success.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396443","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396443","","Stakeholders;Analytical models;Systems Modeling Language;Monitoring","knowledge management;risk management;systems engineering","knowledge transfer;measures of effectiveness;measures of performance;constraint blocks;parametric diagrams;CubeSat;Technical Performance Measures;MOPs;MOEs;system model;system requirements;technical solution;MBSE approach;systems engineering process","","8","","13","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we discuss an innovative solution to this problem based on the capture and implementation of work flow metamodels, linking current tools and working within an existing set of activities or flows, such as to enable linked sharing of relevant information between all participants. The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) [1] standard provides an enabling technology, extended by a configurable metamodel-based approach to incorporate a central organizing structure for data tracking, history and analysis that spans all the domains and stages from concept, requirement, functional and logical design through implementation and test. Additionally, the metamodel extends upon the standard domain capabilities by augmenting each connected tool with communication, GUI and data access that enables direct participation in the lifecycle without the discontinuities and losses usually experienced with separate tools and flows.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-3664-0","10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369587","Systems Engineering;Model Based Systems Engineering;team;process;design;linked data;standards","Tools;Modeling;Standards;Safety;Collaboration;Aircraft","formal specification;graphical user interfaces;groupware;software architecture;software development management;software tools;systems analysis;systems engineering","MBSE development team;system design lifecycle;Systems Engineering development team;synchronization;multidiscipline environments;complex systems;time digital thread;industry standards;work flow metamodels;linked sharing;configurable metamodel;logical design;data tracking;GUI;Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration","","","","4","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As we have observed, the theoretical foundation of MBSE has been well established, but industry-wide adaptations of MBSE are still largely lacking across multidisciplinary engineering areas, including RMS&MA, as evidenced by the fact that there are very few MBSE and RMS&MA integrated analyses being conducted by major US defense and aerospace companies as part of their deliverable artifacts. One of the reasons for this lagging is that the inter-relationships and linkages between RMS&MA analyses and other product design and development disciplines including Systems Engineering requirement analyses (requirement decomposition, requirement and functional flow analysis), product definition data (drawings, specifications), and mission assurance data sets (verification and validation data, qualification, certification and acceptance test data) are not well modeled. As such, some key benefits from MBSE and RMS&MA integration are not fully recognized and realized, which leads to lack of motivation for implementing MBSE with RMS&MA analyses.This paper proposes an MBSE and FMEA Integrated approach using the Vitech GENESYS® tool as a way to overcome the aforementioned weakness.

Variant management has been discussed extensively for the physical layer, but lacks research focusing on functional and logical layers, particularly relevant to concept phase engineering. In System of Systems (SoS) problems, the physical choices are typically constrained by the fact that the interacting systems already exist. This paper therefore studies the implications of variant modelling for the behaviour of the SoS. It explores the possibility of developing a functional architecture that can be extended to accommodate changes due to decisions made in the logical layer. It investigates the formal aspects of including variant modelling into the Systems Modelling Language (SysML) and discusses the potential need for a language extension.","","978-1-4673-8727-9","10.1109/SYSOSE.2016.7542937","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7542937","Design alternatives engineering;variant modelling;variant control;technology-driven change management;MBSE;SoSE;SysML;configuration management","Modeling;Schedules;Biological system modeling;Physical layer;Context","SysML;systems engineering","SysML;systems modelling language;system of systems;concept phase engineering;variant management;exponential information growth;system design lifecycle;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;SoS design alternatives","","3","","13","IEEE","15 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such portion of the product lifecycle often overlooked when allocating resources for digital thread implementation is the logistics and sustainment phase, which in many cases can account for the majority of the total program cost over the lifespan of the product. This paper in particular examines, as a case study, an opportunity for program sustainment to benefit directly from the digital thread by focusing on modeling subsystem block diagrams in SysML, and using those models to assess, verify, and ultimately generate deliverables assessing the Built-In-Test (BIT) capability of a given system. This information in the form of system models or paper deliverables can greatly expedite routine maintenance procedures for example by allowing technicians to quickly locate faulty cable harnesses in the field, or by enabling reliability engineers to verifiably and instantly ensure that BIT faults have complete coverage over all possible failures, including new ones resulting from costly lessons learned in operational usage. The goal of this effort is to outline a specific concept under which BIT behaviors may be modeled in SysML and how they relate to already established subsystem models, but the broader idea of the paper is to present an argument for the very tangible benefits of investing in and establishing a digital thread not just in the design phase of a program, but also across typical company silos and into the product support and sustainment organizations as well.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843533","","Costs;Fault detection;Process control;Companies;Maintenance engineering;Reliability engineering;Modeling","aerospace industry;fault diagnosis;fault location;maintenance engineering;production engineering computing;project management;reliability;software maintenance;systems engineering","Model Based Systems Engineering applied;MBSE;fault detection analysis;vehicle subsystems;aerospace industry;program lifecycle;meaningful applications;cost savings;current company efforts;future company efforts;product lifecycle;allocating resources;digital thread implementation;logistics;sustainment phase;total program cost;program sustainment;subsystem block diagrams;SysML;Built-In-Test capability;system models;paper deliverables;reliability engineers;BIT faults;costly lessons;subsystem models;product support;sustainment organizations","","","","15","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IEM uses a collection of statistical, data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to estimate and forecast the performance of these enterprises. As part of developing the IEM method, models satisfying various detection system evaluation requirements were created. In this work, we extend IEM as a digital twin generation technique by representing modeled processes as executable UML Activity Diagrams and tracing solution processes to problem requirements using ontologies. Using the proposed framework, we can rapidly prototype a digital twin of a detection system that can also be imported and executed in systems engineering simulation software tools such as Cameo Enterprise Architecture Simulation Toolkit. Cyber security and threat detection is a continuous process that requires regular maintenance and testing throughout its lifecycle, but there often exists access issues for sensitive and private data and proprietary detection model details to perform adequate test and evaluation activities in the live production environment. To solve this issue, organizations can use a digital twin technique to create a real-time virtual counterpart of the physical system. We describe a method for creating digital twins of live and/or hypothetical insider threat detection enterprises for the purpose of performing test and evaluation activities on continuous monitoring systems that are sensitive to disruptions.

Systems engineering is not just a technical activity in the lifecycle - it determines the commercial viability of the entire project. The state-of the art answer to these challenges is Model-based Systems Engineering. This article introduces IBM Rational® Best Practices for Model-based Systems Engineering. Using the UML/SysML as a paradigm-independent modeling language, these practices support the elaboration and verification/validation of system requirements as well as design synthesis through model execution. But modeling is not the solution alone. The key for a successful application of the MbSE paradigm is the up-front defining of the underlying workflow; that is where systems engineering stops and where artifacts are handed off to the hardware, software and test engineers. From these pre- and post-conditions the necessary intermediate artifacts and supporting best practices - that are needed to elaborate the agreed upon hand-off - are derived. This article describes an exemplary systems engineering workflow covering the requirements analysis, system functional analysis, and design synthesis phases plus the essential tasks, associated work products and supporting best practices. Collaborative aspects of the systems engineering lifecycle: requirements engineering and change management, will also be addressed.","2155-7209","978-1-4673-1700-9","10.1109/DASC.2012.6382404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6382404","","Analytical models;Computer architecture;Functional analysis;Unified modeling language;Software","formal specification;formal verification;systems analysis;systems engineering","complex system;model-based system engineering;optimal design;technical activity;UML;SysML;paradigm-independent modeling language;system requirement verification;system requirement validation;MbSE paradigm;requirements analysis;system functional analysis;design synthesis phase;associated work products;systems engineering lifecycle;change management;IBM Rational","","7","","4","IEEE","20 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Integrating Reliability Engineering with Model Based Systems Engineering","M. W. Daniels; K. Pierre",Lockheed Martin; Lockheed Martin,"2023 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","5 Apr 2023","2023","","","1","6","Summary & ConclusionsAs fully digital programs become commonplace, it is imperative that Reliability Engineering (RE) adapt to take advantage of all the benefits that Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) offers. At the same time, integrating RE with MBSE cannot result in a loss of modeling and prediction fidelity, nor should it drive significant learning on reliability engineers of new tools and programming languages. The approach should, however, consider the particular nuances of the modeling being performed. This paper describes two distinct techniques for this integration effort adopted by two program areas within the same company. Both approaches contain unique advantages, and it is shown that there is no single best way to perform RE within an MBSE framework.The first approach described performs the reliability analysis in a Microsoft Excel based model. The important properties of the system hardware are captured in a table in Cameo. This table is then exported to Excel and compared to the hardware in the Excel reliability model. Once any hardware changes have been updated, the table can be exported back to Cameo to include the updated reliability properties.The second approach described integrates MATLAB with Cameo. The reliability analysis is either performed in MATLAB or another tool then integrated into MATLAB. Then, through a series of scripts, Cameo connects with the MATLAB analysis to fully integrate the system model with the reliability model.Each of these approaches can be used by a wide variety of programs in diverse industries. The appeal of these approaches is that it allows Reliability Engineers to continue using their current tools while ensuring that their models always align with the current system architecture.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088275","MBSE;Digital Tapestry;Reliability Modeling;R&M Management","Industries;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Systems architecture;Reliability engineering;Mathematical models;Hardware","","","","","","9","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current Italian legislation does not include such Service neither among the “public utility services” ruled by the Maritime Authority (Coast Guard), nor among the “general interest services” ruled by the Port Authority. The lack of a clear definition of the Service is the source of an uncertain situation, in which the activities of the Port Informers derive from local ordinances issued by the single Harbor Master's Offices (Capitanerie di Porto, local office of the Coast Guard). From a different point of view, the continuous evolution in the technological equipment of the authorities involved in port operations, with systems such as Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), Automatic Identification System (AIS), Port Management and Information System (PMIS) and so on, urges the Port Informers to share a common process of migration, in order to be fully integrated in the exploitation of the opportunities made available by the new technologies. A strong need was thus felt for a new regulation of the services provided by the Port Informers at national level, in order to promote a necessary uniformity in the provision of the Service, and to better support the management of port security, maritime traffic monitoring and navigation security.","","978-1-4673-3070-1","10.1109/ITST.2012.6425222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425222","e-Navigation;e-Maritime;MBSE;information management","Ports (Computers);Marine vehicles;Navigation;Monitoring;Radar;Unified modeling language;Legislation","information services;legislation;marine communication;navigation;organisational aspects;sea ports;ships","MBSE application;model-based systems engineering approach;Italian Port Informers Association;solid technical background;port informer service;Italian legislation;public utility services;maritime authority;general interest services;port authority;uncertain situation;harbor master offices;technological equipment;port operations;services regulation;national level;port security management;maritime traffic monitoring;navigation security","","","","8","IEEE","31 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Concluding, the utilization of this standard after applying the theoretical engineering concepts of RAMI 4.0 would strongly enhance the interoperability between industrial systems aligned to the reference architecture on the one hand and provide a practical implementation of its theoretical concepts on the other hand. Therefore, this work-in-progress Paper introduces the first implementation of a bi-directional interface, which interconnects basic engineering with detailed engineering of such systems. As model-based systems engineering (MBSE) with either RAMI 4.0 or AutomationML is currently under broad investigation, already established approaches are used to verify the application of the developed interface.

In contrast to the traditional document-centric paradigm, MBSE applies modelling techniques to support all stages of system development such as design, verification and validation. One of the key advantages of a model-centric approach is the traceability between models in all levels of abstraction, which significantly enhances the adaptability of the system within its life-cycle. In this paper, we apply the MBSE approach to the development of monitoring units in railways, drawing inspiration from primary node controllers found in the automotive industry. The system in question is based on a distributed network of embedded processing units using an automotive architecture and communications backbone. To do so, we consider case studies that focus on: passenger comfort-matching environmental controls to occupancy; operational efficiency — correlating over occupancy to dwell times, for example; and reporting / investigation — identification and logging of signal aspects the vehicle passes to reduce investigation times for SPADs. As a result, we contend that the use of model based systems engineering can provide an extra level of verification that considerably increases the robustness of monitoring systems and efficiency in their development.","","978-1-78561-345-6","10.1049/cp.2016.1199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920673","","","condition monitoring;railway engineering","railway monitoring system robustness;model-based system engineering;model-centric approach;MBSE approach;primary node controller;automotive industry;distributed network;embedded processing unit;automotive architecture;communication backbone;passenger comfort","","1","","","","8 May 2017","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These foundation medical systems define Concepts of Operations (ConOps) and identify generic requirements for medical systems based on generic crew and mission environment assumptions and guidance from NASA standards (e.g., medical “Levels of Care”). By making the transition, ExMC intends to improve communication with stakeholders regarding foundation medical system requirements and content. This, in turn, will translate into user-centric medical system development for mission-specific medical systems and result in more robust systems that will lead to better communication with stakeholders to identify gaps in diagnostic and treatment capabilities, thereby lowering crew treatment risks. ExMC's Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) paradigm facilitates stakeholder's understanding of the system, more frequent updates of project content, and a centralized “source of truth” for the project. For this current foundation medical system development effort, ExMC has expanded its use of MBSE to include all ConOps content within the model. Previously, the ConOps content primarily resided within a published document, with only select content being incorporated into the model. This effort required structural and organizational workflow changes, including showing stakeholders how the information they require would be presented in the model and gaining their acceptance of this approach. This paper documents key lessons learned during the transformation of the Medical System ConOps from a document- to model-centric system, focusing on how the resultant model represents information, the agile workflows used by Systems Engineers when developing the model, how the model integrates into project plans, how ExMC leadership influenced key users to accept the proposed transformation, and, finally, how the users interact with the newly developed model and its available information.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843691","NASA's Human Research Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843691","","Leadership;NASA;Decision making;Focusing;Documentation;Stakeholders;Reliability","formal specification;health care;human resource management;medical information systems;organisational aspects;systems analysis;systems engineering;workflow management software","Model-based Systems Engineering journey;NASA's Human Research Program;traditional document-centric;model-centric Systems Engineering approach;foundation medical systems;generic crew;mission environment assumptions;medical Levels;stakeholders;foundation medical system requirements;user-centric medical system development;mission-specific medical systems;robust systems;ExMC's Model-based Systems Engineering paradigm;current foundation medical system development effort;ConOps content;Medical System ConOps;model-centric system;resultant model;Systems Engineers;newly developed model","","","","14","USGov","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

No longer isolated MBSE tools can suffice without a flexible infrastructure to support model integration, tool interoperability, experimentation, and data collection. This recognition provides the impetus for developing a MBSE research testbed for prototyping and evaluating aerospace systems and system-of-systems.

Multi-UAV swarms are used in a variety of missions ranging from search and rescue and perimeter security of high value physical assets to emergency response and infrastructure inspection. These operations are characterized by adaptive coordination, ability to survive systemic malfunctions and unexpected external disruptions, ability to discern and reach safe states when attempting to cope with unknown disruptions, ability to course correct and continuously adapt in partially observable, reactive environments.

This inspection equipment is often explicitly designed, developed and manufactured for a single product with large expenditure of time. In order to have the inspection equipment ready by the start of production (SoP) and to be sure that the product requirements are transferred to the product development, an integrative mechatronic product and inspection equipment development procedure is necessary. Nowadays, the development of complex mechatronic systems is often carried out with the help of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods, for example in the fields of aerospace, automotive and defense.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach to the specification of the system design. To this end, we explore the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) principles in mitigating the design complexity of the PL architecture for the VLC system. Design concerns and gaps are addressed by developing an executable black-box system model that specifies the conceptual architecture of the system, and a parametric model that analyzes multiple system configurations based on generated values for the signal-to-noise ratio and bit error rate parameters.

Additionally, the process of generating safety artifacts is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. As a result, safety analysis often requires re- work, is expensive, and increases system development time. Several model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approaches have been developed to automatically generate certain safety artifacts. However, these approaches only cover part of the system design and safety life cycle. To truly leverage the benefits of MBSE, system design must be undertaken together with safety analysis for the entire life cycle, and multiple safety artifacts must be generated from the same model. Moreover, MBSE approaches that require a model transformation between the system design and the safety model suffer from the inability to automatically reflect changes made to a safety artifact in the system and the safety model. This paper presents a framework to integrate the entire system design and safety life cycle using an MBSE approach. Both the system design and the safety data are captured in a single SysML model, from which safety artifacts such as failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) tables and fault trees are automatically generated. This framework ensures consistency between the system design and the safety analysis by requiring no model transformation, thus reducing the resources required for safety analysis. The proposed Integrated System Design and Safety (ISDS) framework comprises three phases that together cover the entire system design and safety life cycle.

Often, the SoS is modeled in all its complexity, at a single level of abstraction or level of detail. Instead of a “mega-model” approach, a standards-based, layered “model of models” (MOM) approach is what is necessary. This paper discusses use of the Object Management Group (OMG) Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF (UPDM) for architecture modeling. UPDM supports a MOM approach by enabling the development of integrated model layers such as an outcomes model layer and a component layer. An integrated, layered MOM is in keeping with the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach. The model layers can be referenced when detailed analysis is required, or hidden when a SoS viewpoint is required.","","978-1-4799-7611-9","10.1109/SYSOSE.2015.7151944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7151944","Systems of Systems;modeling;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Unified Architecture Framework;Unified Profile for DoDAF and MODAF","Analytical models;Standards;Adaptation models;Method of moments;Collaboration","object-oriented programming;software architecture;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","UAF;system of systems modeling;SoS simulation;SoS modeling;SoS management;abstraction level;detail level;standard-based layered model of models approach;Object Management Group;OMG;Unified Profile-for-DoDAF-and-MODAF;UPDM;architecture modeling;integrated model layers;outcomes model layer;component layer;integrated layered MOM;model-based systems engineering approach;MBSE approach","","11","","27","IEEE","9 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Manufacturers are quite conservative in adopting new technologies because the vast majority of existing infrastructures already have constraints in place related to their investment capabilities and to the integration of new technologies with their legacy systems and processes. To overcome this conservatism, migration strategies and decision-making approaches are required to support industry in adopting the next generation of smart production systems step by step, taking into account not only the technical aspects, but also integrating organizational and economical issues. One essential part of these approaches is the comparative evaluation of migration options. Based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), this paper proposes an approach that supports the evaluation of possible migration scenarios towards cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) by using the System Modeling Language (SysML).","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088287","cyber-physical production systems;migration strategy;model-based systems engineering;SysML","Production systems;Modeling;Industries;Automation;Production facilities;Aging","decision making;intelligent manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;software engineering;SysML;systems engineering","cyber-physical production systems;System Modeling Language;SysML;migration strategies;decision-making approaches;migration options;model-based systems engineering;smart production systems;MBSE;CPPS","","5","","20","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modern automated driving systems (ADS) must safely handle a considerable number of driving scenarios in compliance with the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) standard. While model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has successfully proven itself in the automotive industry as an enabler for complex system and test design, common procedures are neither scenario-based nor do they consider SOTIF. It is yet to be shown, how MBSE approaches can meet these specific requirements of ADS development and, what advantages they can offer over non-model-based methods.In this paper, an extended variant of the established feature-driven MBSE procedure CUBE is presented that includes the analysis of use cases and scenarios. Use-case-specific logical scenarios and the corresponding expected behavior and system architecture are specified using SysML profile extensions. It is demonstrated, how specification model artifacts are used for identifying potentially hazardous scenarios and functional deficiencies and how SOTIF analysis results flow back into the specification process by means of the function “Multi-Story Car Park Chauffeur”. The SysML model is linked to a safety argumentation created using the Goal Structuring Notation to integrate the system specification and the evidence from the SOTIF analysis in a single procedure and toolchain, ensuring full traceability.","","978-1-6654-8821-1","10.1109/IV51971.2022.9827151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827151","","Industries;Analytical models;Costs;Intelligent vehicles;Systems architecture;Product development;Safety","formal specification;formal verification;hazards;product development;systems engineering","ADS development;automated driving functions;automotive industry;common procedures;complex system;established feature-driven MBSE procedure CUBE;functional deficiencies;Intended Functionality standard;MBSE approaches;model-based systems engineering procedure;modern automated driving systems;nonmodel-based methods;potentially hazardous scenarios;product development;product verification;scenario-based;single procedure;SOTIF analysis results;SOTIF-compliant design;specification model artifacts;specification process;SysML model;system architecture;system specification;test design;toolchain;use-case-specific logical scenarios","","1","","23","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within the MIAMI effort, the Sounding Rocket Team, led by George Plattsmier (MSFC) and George Turner (GSFC), has implemented MBSE within the domain of NASA Sounding Rocket Operations Contract (NSROC)Sounding Rocket missions, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML)to outline system architectures, requirements, mission assurance, stakeholders, events, and deliverables. The current team effort supports the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) experiment. The rocket team, focused on the mission planning and execution domain, is working in tandem with a MIAMI Sounding Rocket MaGIXS experiment team, focused on the experiment domain, to model the mission, systems, experiment, and interfaces to produce and deploy an integrated mission model. Through communication and coordination between NASA and the Sounding Rocket Program Office (SRPO), the MIAMI Sounding Rocket team is tailoring their pilot efforts to specific deliverables identified as critical throughout the full mission lifecycle by Nathan Empson (Mission Operations Manager) and others at SRPO. These products, as part of an overall NASA MBSE pilot effort, will enable evaluation of the utility of MBSE for sounding rocket missions. The team coordinates their work through a spiral development process punctuated by “sprints” to seam together the advancements in defining architecture and behavior of the systems involved, with the various technologies and analyses used to bolster the modeling effort. For developing technologies and modeling patterns, the team continues to interface with the Computer Aided Engineering Systems Environment (CAESE) team at JPL to explore and expand the system “model” from a MagicDraw server project to a nodal system of tools and services that delivers to stakeholders at various levels of cognizance. This environment is centered around an “authoritative source of truth”, known as the Integrated Mission Model upon which several interfaces are integrated such that users throughout all regions of the model see data, commits, updates, and structural changes in real time for a better collaboration workspace throughout the project. In the current instance of this modeling network, the Integrated Mission model uses the individual MagicDraw models for the rocket team and the experiment team, where modelers commit up to the master model, and use synchronized checkouts and updates. This allows for better version control, user permission allocation, and support for distributed work efforts to improve collaborative efficiency. The current state and future state of the team effort is to appropriate the tools and libraries available to meet the desired use-cases requested by NSROC. Throughout the process of MBSE integration, the larger goal through MIAMI is to project high-level modeling concepts and implementations into useable and tractable deliverables for small missions. Additionally, through support and development of the model as applied to MaGIXS, re-usability is achieved so that the efficiency of modeling itself is improved.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741966","","Rockets;NASA;Stakeholders;Tools;Data models","aerospace computing;computer aided engineering;configuration management;groupware;rockets;software tools;space research;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","NASA-wide effort;MIAMI effort;NASA Sounding Rocket Operations Contract;rocket missions;Systems Modeling Language;system architectures;mission assurance;current team effort;mission planning;execution domain;MIAMI Sounding Rocket MaGIXS experiment team;experiment domain;integrated mission model;Sounding Rocket Program Office;MIAMI Sounding Rocket team;mission lifecycle;Mission Operations Manager;NASA MBSE pilot effort;modeling effort;modeling patterns;system model;nodal system;master model;distributed work efforts;MBSE integration;project high-level modeling concepts;model based systems engineering;MagicDraw models;cross lifecycle modeling;Marshall grazing incidence X-Ray spectrometer experiment;computer aided engineering systems environment team","","4","","5","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An attempt to design EMU based on the MBSE approach in China was introduced, taking the door control system as an example. The design is divided into three stages including requirement analysis, function breakdown and system architecture generation, which are interrelated with four design loops. The requirement and use case model, function model, as well as logical and physical architecture model of the door control system were built with SysML.

A key difference between the past and today is that the digital information revolution offers new ways for improvements to manage complex systems, enhance knowledge transfer, and improve communications. These new ways offer reductions in cost, schedule, and risk. Over the past several years, the NASA Systems Engineering community has explored ways to use the digital environment to realize these benefits. The NASA Systems Engineering community began evaluating the adoption of a digital approach or Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) as early as 2011. The effort performed benchmarking of industry, evaluated standards, discussed infrastructure requirements, and interviewed NASA stakeholders. In 2016, the MBSE Pathfinder was established to evaluate application of MBSE to some of the most challenging aspects of real NASA spaceflight systems. The following year, the MBSE Pathfinder expanded to more rigorous implementation and coverage across multiple phases of the system engineering lifecycle. Two years of learning, alignment, and application resulted in over a dozen concrete use cases that illustrate the benefits of a digital framework for systems engineering. The MBSE Pathfinder informed the plans to move NASA towards enterprise implementation of MBSE. This paper highlights examples in which both quantitative and qualitative benefits were obtained. The first example shows how systems engineering models used for concept design and definition were re-used for verification and test for a rocket engine. Schedule metrics were tracked to determine the improvement when using MBSE compared to recent historical data from manual methods. The second example shows the seamless transfer of modeling elements and data between the systems engineering model, computer aided design model, loads analysis, and additive manufacturing software for a payload adapter. This example shows how MBSE can be used to validate concepts and perform rapid prototyping. Qualitative benefits include improved communications and customer satisfaction. These examples, and others in a rich portfolio of results, demonstrate benefits available at points across the entire lifecycle in a rapid, agile approach. The MBSE Pathfinder projects were set up deliberately to sample multiple points in the lifecycle to understand the nuances and requirements sooner, rather than following one project end-to-end. The results from the MBSE Pathfinder help define the infrastructure and requirements necessary for a future systems engineering capability and provide a guide towards a full-up, integrated approach to systems development. To organize and implement these goals, the MBSE Pathfinder expanded into the MBSE Infusion and Modernization Initiative (MIAMI). The approach as well as the structure of MIAMI is unique in that it relies on learning from the use of MBSE on real projects and capturing the benefits that are useful for working engineers to make systems engineering easier. The lessons from this work are available for use by those who are interested in learning from or partnering with MIAMI.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741795","","NASA;Solid modeling;Rockets;Analytical models;Adaptation models","aerospace computing;CAD;systems engineering","MIAMI;NASA applications;digital information revolution;complex systems;NASA stakeholders;NASA spaceflight systems;systems engineering model;rocket engine;MBSE Pathfinder projects;model-based systems engineering;MBSE infusion and modernization initiative;NASA systems engineering community;computer aided design model;additive manufacturing software","","9","","11","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past decade, the need to perform an engineering analysis in the early steps of the system's life cycle has opened avenues for joint use of MBSE and Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and optimization (MDAO). MDAO is fully dedicated to Analysis and optimization: the model is restricted to a single aspect of the system that is described in details in a formal language that will be the input of the associated computing tool. This paper surveys and categorizes MBSE and MDAO approaches for better understanding of how MBSE and MDAO can be associated in a systems engineering project. Lessons learned from this literature survey will be used in the framework of French project Concorde. One major expected achievement of the project is to design and implement a methodology to populate parts of the MDAO modeling approach directly from the MBSE one, applied to a UAV case study.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447140","Modeling;Multi-Paradigm;MBSE;MDAO","Analytical models;Conferences;Computational modeling;Bibliographies;Formal languages;Focusing;Switches","aerospace computing;aerospace engineering;aircraft;design engineering;optimisation;systems engineering","bibliography survey;document-centric engineering;Model Based Systems Engineering;interdisciplinary systems;behavioral descriptions;engineering analysis;Multidisciplinary Design Analysis;systems engineering project;MDAO modeling;MBSE;top-down model based approach;design decision validation;French project;Concorde;aircraft design","","2","","55","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the basic of complexity management, complexity analysis is used to measure the system complexity for system solution trade-offs. Using traditional MBSE approaches, system architectures of product are formalized as MBSE models whose complexity measurement provides cues to quantitative trade-offs. In this paper, an MBSE approach is proposed to support complex analysis using qualitative and quantitative approaches. A GOPPRR approach is first proposed to support MBSE formalisms. Then a complexity measurement formula is used to calculate the structure complexity of the MBSE models. Finally, through a tool-chain developed based on Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC), a visualization tool is used to analyze the system complexity by measuring and visualizing the model complexity.

For example, due to the iterative nature of the design and safety life cycle, there is constant data transformation and feedback of information between the system design models, safety analyses, and safety verification. Data transformation and feedback are often manually performed by engineers, which is time-consuming and error prone and can introduce inconsistencies in safety assessments. Although several model-based systems engineering approaches have been developed for safety analysis and safety verification, current approaches do not address the inconsistencies introduced in the safety assessment process. This study describes the Integrated System Design and Safety (ISDS) framework, which is a model-based safety assessment framework that aims to eliminate such inconsistencies. The framework combines a model-based safety analysis approach with a model-based safety verification. This paper extends previous work, which focused on the model-based safety analysis approach, to describe the model-based safety verification approach adopted in the ISDS framework. Safety verification is performed using a simulation-based fault injection approach and enabled by a fault injection engine, which injects failures into the system design and characterizes system behaviors to identify safety violations impacting the system. The results from the case study, in which the framework is used to assess the safety of a forward collision warning system, highlight that the algorithms and automated feedback loops of the framework can reduce inconsistencies in the safety assessment process while also identifying safety violations impacting the system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3193495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837899","Model-based systems engineering (MBSE);safety analysis;failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA);systems engineering;SysML;simulation-based fault injection;safety verification","Safety;Analytical models;System analysis and design;Modeling;Model checking;Computational modeling;Behavioral sciences","feedback;formal verification;road safety;safety;safety-critical software;systems engineering","safety assessments;model-based systems engineering approaches;safety assessment process;Integrated System Design;Safety framework;model-based safety assessment framework;model-based safety analysis approach;model-based safety verification approach;simulation-based fault injection approach;system behaviors;safety violations;forward collision warning system;modern engineered systems;constant data transformation;feedback;system design models;safety analyses","","","","63","CCBY","25 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, despite these benefits, they are among the most under-appreciated of transportation engineering systems. Looking ahead, the long-term view is not rosy. Failures, delays, incidents, and accidents in aging waterway systems are doing little to attract the technical and economic assistance required for modernization and sustainability. We argue that programs for waterway and canal modernization and sustainability can benefit significantly from system thinking, supported by systems engineering techniques. To support this claim, we develop a framework for the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) design of modern waterways, especially canal systems. The proposed framework supports organizational, requirements and engineering models. Semi-formal modeling techniques are employed for the representation of project goals and scenarios and high-level models of behavior and structure. The essential features of this framework are highlighted in a case study where model-based systems engineering procedures are used for the design and analysis of a post-Panamax waterlock system. Formal verification procedures to demonstrate that essential system properties such as safety, liveliness and reachability are satisfied are currently under development.","","978-1-4799-2086-0","10.1109/SysCon.2014.6819274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819274","","Irrigation;Modeling;Unified modeling language;Biological system modeling;Marine vehicles;Mathematical model;Organizations","canals;formal verification;globalisation;goods distribution;systems engineering;transportation","model-based systems engineering design;canal systems;global trade;transportation engineering systems;technical assistance;economic assistance;waterway modernization;canal modernization;system thinking;MBSE design;semiformal modeling techniques;project goal representation;high-level model behavior;high-level model structure;postPanamax waterlock system analysis;postPanamax waterlock system design;formal verification procedures;automated waterway system operation;waterway system design;bulk goods transportation;containerized goods transportation;waterway sustainability;canal sustainability","","","","20","IEEE","22 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A unique aspect of the pre-project work was a strong emphasis and investment on the foundations of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). As so often happens in this business, plans changed: NASA's budget and science priorities were released and together fundamentally changed the course of JEO. As a result, it returned to being a study task whose objective is to propose more affordable ways to accomplish the science. As part of this transition, the question arose as to whether it could continue to afford the investment in MBSE. In short, the MBSE infusion has survived and is providing clear value to the study effort. In the process, the need to remain relevant in the new environment has brought about a wave of innovation and progress. By leveraging the existing infrastructure and a modest additional investment, striking advances in the capture and analysis of designs using MBSE were achieved. The effort has reaffirmed the importance of architecting. It has successfully harnessed the synergistic relationship of architecting to system modeling. We have found that MBSE can provide greater agility than traditional methods. We have also found that a diverse `ecosystem' of modeling tools and languages (SysML, Mathematica, even Excel) is not only viable, but an important enabler of agility and adaptability. This paper will describe the successful application of MBSE in the dynamic environment of early mission formulation, the significant results produced and lessons learned in the process.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187337","","Adaptation models;Computer architecture;Analytical models;Ontologies;Unified modeling language","aerospace computing;astronomy computing;Jupiter;software architecture;systems engineering","model based systems engineering;Europa mission;Jupiter Europa Orbiter mission;JEO mission;MBSE;NASA;investment;system architecture;system modeling;ecosystem;modeling tool;SysML;Mathematica;Excel;dynamic environment;mission formulation","","15","","16","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of modelling and simulation for ongoing analysis forms the backbone of various SoS Engineering (SoSE) methodologies, and many of the challenges that arise in SoSE apply equally to the modelling, simulation and analysis of complex integrated systems. Weapons and Combat Systems Division, in collaboration with other Australian Department of Defence agencies, is developing a modelling, simulation and analysis capability in order to investigate the performance of integrated defence systems. The execution of this development is being undertaken in the form of a “study series” based on the SoSE Wave Model and is composed of discrete sub-studies. Each of these sub-studies is used to progressively increase the complexity of the scenario being modelled (both number of systems being modelled and model fidelity) whilst performing analysis and answering questions for Defence stakeholders. This approach ensures regular and ongoing feedback and investment from client groups, and that the final modelling and simulation capability is fit-for-purpose to meet the strategic objectives. The study series operates on a yearly cycle of analysis where traditional model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approaches are employed to support the analytical and top-level model requirements definition. However, the developers of the various software models used within the study series commonly apply Agile-based methodologies, in accordance with current software engineering best practice. A hybrid methodology has been developed to manage this, incorporating components of more traditional MBSE tools and techniques at the study level, and Agile methodologies for model development. This paper describes this hybrid methodology, including how MBSE is utilised to manage an evolving, complex, SoS simulation capability, define study requirements, and integrate with an Agile software model development approach. The paper employs an unclassified aerospace example in which modelling and simulation-based analyses have been applied to explore how different Uninhabited Aerial System concepts could be implemented in concert with other platforms to enhance an Anti-Ship Missile Defence capability. The requirements definition approaches are explored from both the analysts' and model developers' perspectives.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438152","","Analytical models;Missiles;Tools;Stability analysis;Complexity theory;Modeling;Best practices","aerospace computing;computer simulation;military computing;missiles;software prototyping;systems engineering","analytical model requirements;MBSE;defence stakeholders;Australian Department of Defence agencies;Weapons and Combat Systems Division;SoS engineering;complex weapon systems of systems;SoSE wave model;top-level model requirements;agile software model development;uninhabited aerial system;anti-ship missile defence capability;simulation-based analyses;SoS simulation;software engineering;software models;model-based systems engineering;integrated defence systems;complex integrated systems;agile methodologies","","","","14","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In complex, evolving, and dynamic environments, the human operator’s ability to efficiently observe, orient, decide, and act is imperative. However, the operator’s performance can be degraded during changes in UAS custody between ABMs and pilots, which significantly increases operator cognitive workload beyond that typically seen in previous missions. Unfortunately, C2 technology development often places a heavy focus on automation and hardware, leaving the human operator underrepresented to the detriment human-automation interactions. Currently, Digital Engineering and Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools are rapidly being adopted in system development, integration, and management to support the complex development effort necessary to integrate these systems. The current research integrated human considerations in MBSE tools to analyze human-automation teaming during the development process. The method supports representation of the automation assistance and human operators during a modeled mission simulation in a pair of specialized activity diagrams referred to as the Mission Actor Diagram and the OODA2 Activity Diagram, permitting analysis of errors and bottlenecks during operation.

Various projects have been carried out successfully during the last years and demonstrated the power behind the overall concept - and the practical problems to reach the ambitious overall goals. Whereas the first steps of MBSE like the iterative modeling of requirements, designs, behaviors, and tests became standard procedures in Systems Engineering (SE), the transition to simulation often is still restricted to quite simple scenarios. Although elaborated system models deliver all the information needed, the simulation of the overall system in prospective working environments interacting with other systems is rather an exception. The problem is that there is still quite a gap between the first SE steps and the various algorithms simulation technology can offer today. Major reasons for this seem to be the resulting complexity of the system model when modeling complex interactions, the complexity of using state-of-the-art simulation technology and the absence of simulation frameworks for simulations across multiple domains and disciplines. ""Experimentable Digital Twins"", a concept originally developed for the eRobotics methodology, seem to have the potential to close the gap between SE and simulation by introducing a new structuring element to configure simulations. A new simulation system architecture integrating well-known simulation algorithms provides Virtual Testbeds for the simultaneous simulation of a network of different Digital Twins interacting with each other in various ways (i.e. a network of different systems, their components and their working environment).

MBSE offers approaches that can address issues associated with cost, complexity and safety. Focus groups with Airbus spacecraft functional avionics engineers have highlighted that one way this can be achieved is by performing early functional validation of the high-level spacecraft functional avionics system. This paper defines an approach to the application of MBSE to perform early functional validation of a spacecraft. This approach acts as an extension to a methodology in development by Airbus. It focusses on the definition of the Concept of Operations during Phase B. Information traditionally contained in a Mission Operations Concept Document is presented through a Mission Operations Concept Model. The aim is to improve the clarity, consistency and quality of the information being communicated by providing a model template to contain the relevant system information and enable the high-level simulation of the design. This high-level simulation is enabled by the execution of static systems engineering diagrams. The mission phases are defined and a mission profile, determined by the orbit characteristics, specifies the duration of each phase. The system mode diagram details the response of the system to a change in the mission phase, and activity diagrams describe the functions that must be performed by the system in each mode. Executing this information allows the response of the system to be analysed and validated against high-level mission needs. Traditionally, this level of analysis would not be available at this early stage. The approach replaces ad hoc calculations with a formal representation of the system that can be executed, interrogated and quantified. The structure of the spacecraft system is represented by block definition and internal block diagrams, and the functionality by executable state machine and activity diagrams. Textual requirements are presented and maintained within the model and are formally linked to the physical and functional architectures. These requirements are refined by mathematical constraints that can be satisfied by calculations performed during the simulation. The use case discussed in this paper focusses on the data handling unit onboard an Earth-observation spacecraft. The system response in terms of the onboard memory usage throughout the mission is calculated. The onboard memory consists of three directories - one for housekeeping telemetry and two for science data. The simulation shows that for the chosen orbit, the total onboard memory allocation is adequate and provides a solution for the optimum memory allocation between the three directories. Ultimately, a flexible Mission Operations Concept Model template will be derived for use on future projects, which will enable them to realise the benefits demonstrated in the use case: improved control, communication and early validation of the functional avionics system design.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741767","","Space vehicles;Biomass;Unified modeling language;Biological system modeling;Object oriented modeling","aerospace computing;avionics;data handling;space vehicles;systems analysis;systems engineering;text analysis","functional avionics system design;early validation;MBSE;traditional approach;clarity;maintainability;systems engineering projects;Airbus spacecraft functional avionics engineers;early functional validation;high-level spacecraft functional avionics system;relevant system information;high-level simulation;static systems engineering diagrams;mission phase;mission profile;activity diagrams;high-level mission needs;spacecraft system;internal block diagrams;physical architectures;functional architectures;Earth-observation spacecraft;system response;model-based systems engineering;document-based systems engineering;system mode diagram;flexible mission operations concept model template","","6","","27","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on this approach, the KARMA language has been proposed to formalize models, metamodels, and code generation but lacks support for the model querying. This paper proposed one query language based on the GOPPRR metamodeling approach extended from the KARMA language to realize the unified query formalisms for multi-domain models. Finally, a case in a vehicle tracking system development is used to verify the availability of model query language, which is implemented in a domain modeling tool, MetaGraph.

The creation of this system model facilitates data presentation by providing a mechanism from which information can be extracted by automated manipulation of model content. Existing MBSE tools enable model creation, but are often too complex for the unfamiliar model viewer to easily use. These tools do not yet provide many opportunities for easing into the development and use of a system model when system design documentation already exists. This study creates a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) Document Traceability Framework (SDTF) for integrating design documentation with a system model, and develops an Interactive Visualization Engine for SysML Tools (InVEST), that exports consistent, clear, and concise views of SysML model data. These exported views are each meaningful to a variety of project stakeholders with differing subjects of concern and depth of technical involvement. InVEST allows a model user to generate multiple views and reports from a MBSE model, including wiki pages and interactive visualizations of data. System data can also be filtered to present only the information relevant to the particular stakeholder, resulting in a view that is both consistent with the larger system model and other model views. Viewing the relationships between system artifacts and documentation, and filtering through data to see specialized views improves the value of the system as a whole, as data becomes information.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-1622-1","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836268","","Visualization;NASA;Data models;Data visualization;Materials;Standards","data visualisation;filtering theory;interactive systems;SysML;system documentation;systems engineering","model-driven visualization tool;model-based systems engineering projects;Systems Modeling Language;SysML document traceability framework;interactive visualization engine;SysML tools;InVEST;MBSE model;interactive data visualizations;system artifacts;documentation;data filtering","","2","","14","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Massive open online courses and similar online offerings are a new opportunity to learn about industry practices. In this paper, we draw on data from the “Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems” online program from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has enrolled 4200 participants, to understand how models are used in practice. We use aggregated data from questions to investigate model use by participants and their organizations. The results demonstrate that whereas modeling is widely recognized for its potential, the actual deployment against problems of interest is substantially lower than the participant-stated potential. We also find that many participants reported low use of basic modeling best practices, such as specialized programs.

The SysReqs and emerging architecture are constructed through gradual and iterative transition from the problem domain and operational stakeholder requirements to the conceptual solution domain. They later constitute the basis for functional requirements elaborating, concept formation, technology selection, function-to-form allocation, and asset utilization. Only rarely can stakeholder requirements (SHRs) readily translate to SysReqs. Systems engineers must therefore elicit, analyze, and evolve the SysReqs, as these will radically affect the system's performance, robustness, endurance, and appeal. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a framework for effective and consistent systems engineering and architecting. MBSE relies on modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM). OPM is a holistic MBSE paradigm and language for complex systems and processes, standardized as ISO 19450, which relies on the principle of minimal universal ontology. In this paper, we propose a model-based requirement engineering (MBRE) approach to facilitate the transition from SHRs to SysReqs, and from SysReqs to system architecture specification. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework in architecting a robotic baggage loading system for a leading international airport.","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088273","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Object-Process Methodology;Requirements Engineering;Systems Architecting","Modeling;Stakeholders;Unified modeling language;Requirements engineering;Standards;Complex systems","aerospace computing;airports;formal specification;formal verification;ISO standards;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software architecture;systems analysis;systems engineering;technology management","operational stakeholder requirements;function-to-form allocation;SysReqs;MBSE;modeling languages;system architecture specification;robotic baggage loading system;system requirements;complex systems development;systems engineering;model-based requirements engineering;model-based systems engineering;MBRE;functional requirements elaboration;concept formation;technology selection;international airport;minimal universal ontology;ISO 19450 standardization","","10","","29","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The drive from both domains is for more functionality and efficiency from vehicles. The resultant effect on system development means the complexity of the designs has increased and thus the complexity of the virtual simulations used for test and analysis has also increased. When actual systems or their components are integrated with the simulation environment, live-virtual testing places real-time demands on the testing of the architecture and environment. This paper describes a proposed innovative approach, derived from aerospace engineering, where the vehicle requirements are allocated to relations between the elements in the architecture and not just to system elements. An approach to using the relational oriented modelling structure for test and analysis is also described. The requirements and system architecture models specified using relational orientation are therefore seen to provide an early demonstration of a rigorous new approach to system of systems design, test and analysis that uses requirements trace ability at the architecture level. This approach promises to bring better trace ability of system requirements to the simulation of vehicle behaviour in general and to real time behaviour in particular.","2375-5261","978-1-4799-4430-9","10.1109/ISORC.2014.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6899174","relational orientation;system architecture;requirement traceability;relation oriented systems engineering;integration;MBSE;models;model driven architecture;environments;frameworks","Unified modeling language;Computer architecture;Analytical models;Data models;Real-time systems;Vehicles","architectural CAD;virtual reality","model based systems engineering;virtual vehicle architecture model;V2AM;live virtual testing;prototyping;aero-auto domains;architecture modelling;systems engineering design;simulation environment;live-virtual testing;aerospace engineering;vehicle requirements;relational oriented modelling structure;system architecture models;relational orientation;system of systems design;requirements trace ability;architecture level;vehicle behaviour;real time behaviour","","","","22","IEEE","18 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For safety-critical systems, the integration between model-based systems engineering and model-based safety assessment to improve the choice of the system architecture since the early design stage becomes a necessity. One of the integration solutions is to generate fault trees (FTs), either static or dynamic, directly from the system description. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the generation of the dynamic fault trees (DFTs) of the systems that contain redundancies, which is widely used in safety-critical systems to enhance their reliability. The goal of this paper is, first, to propose a redundancy profile and, second, to automatically generate the DFTs from system models. Since errors are propagated via input and output ports of the components, the generation process starts with a depth-first search graph traversal through the systems modeling language internal block diagram of the system. This diagram is considered as a multidirected graph in order to detect the external inputs, the nonredundant components, the switch components, and the redundant components of the system.

Due to the varied methodologies and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE). The purpose of this article is to provide a cursory description of the SoS basic concepts on the one hand, and then to analyse the main challenges in its development. Finally, we report the literature review showing various techniques and methods that have been modified from the conventional systems engineering to better fit the needs of SoSs design. We hope the findings of this work may encourage and inform the community researchers of the creation of a more holistic and unified engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these large-scale systems. Thus, the complexity of the SoS development lends itself nicely to a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) which provides communication and verification that transcends the levels of development. MBSE uses a model or set of models to document and communicate from the system requirements level down to the software implementation level.","","978-1-6654-2231-4","10.1109/ICAASE51408.2020.9380125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380125","Literature Review;System-of-Systems;SoS Engineering;Model-Based Systems Engineering","Bibliographies;Systems engineering and theory;Software;Stakeholders;Modeling;System of systems;Software engineering","decentralised control;large-scale systems;software engineering;systems engineering","SoS development;Model-Based Systems Engineering;system requirements;path forward;monolithic systems;decentralized control mechanism;single unified consensus;system-of-systems engineering;literature review;conventional systems engineering;SoSs design;holistic engineering process;unified engineering process;large-scale systems;system of system modelling;SoSE;MBSE;software implementation level","","3","","52","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our MBSE frameworks and languages contain semantic richness sufficient to describe our systems at any particular point in time, often with an emphasis on the description of the system at major milestones. This is unarguably a real asset. However, when we apply MBSE in service of missions that are in development, rapidly evolving, of a larger scale, and where interpersonal communication is a critical part of the design process, we discover that our frameworks and languages are still not quite rich enough to enable us to ask the kinds of questions and get the kinds of answers we want in order to address the concerns of day to day work. This paper will discuss some patterns and tools we have developed to help address some of the not-always-explicit SE concerns that we have identified through our MBSE work.

Evidence across the Services and industry has affirmed digital engineering is a critical practice necessary to support acquisition in an environment of increasing global challenges, dynamic threats, rapidly evolving technologies, and increasing life expectancy of our systems currently in operation. Digital engineering updates the systems engineering practices to take full advantage of computational technology, modeling, data analytics, and data sciences. The Department of Defense's vision for digital engineering is to modernize how the Department designs, develops, delivers, operates, and sustains systems, while continuing to practice systems engineering efficiently and effectively. Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way acquisition and engineering are performed across a wide range of government agencies, industries, and academia. As the Department of Defense transitions to digital engineering, there is a need to develop and maintain an acquisition workforce and culture that is literate in model-based engineering, competent in digital engineering models, methods, tools, and understands digital artifacts across the acquisition lifecycle.This paper outlines the development of the Digital Engineering Competency Framework by the Systems Engineering Research Center. The purpose of the Digital Engineering Competency Framework is to provide clear guidance for the Department of Defense acquisition workforce, in particular the engineering acquisition workforce, through clearly defined competencies that illuminate the knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors required for digital engineering professionals. The approach taken to develop the Digital Engineering Competency Framework draws from existing competency models discovered during a literature search and from the practicing Digital Engineering community. The development process for the Digital Engineering Competency Framework relied initially on literature findings to develop a draft model that was reviewed by subject matter experts through a series of workshops. No existing competency models focused on digital engineering (or model-based systems engineering or model-based engineering) were found during the literature review. However, several related competency models were identified, and these informed the initial draft model. At appropriate points, the draft model(s) were assessed through community presentations and industry review and appropriate revisions were made.The Digital Engineering Competency Framework has currently completed several iterations of subject matter expert review and revisions and is approaching a finalized general structure. The overarching structure of the DECF will consist of competency areas, proficiency levels within the competency, and constituting knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors. The specific knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors that will be associated with each competency area are the primary elements still changing in current iterations. Once the model is finalized, it will be compared with the existing Defense Acquisition University curriculum to determine what elements of such existing curriculum already support these competencies. Gaps will be noted, and training recommendations will be developed. As with the development of the model itself, this will be an iterative process. Another critical use case for the Digital Engineering Competency Framework is to enable hiring for Digital Engineering Positions, given Competency models and frameworks are used by hiring managers to ensure that individuals have the required and appropriate skillsets to adequately perform their jobs.","2472-9647","978-1-7281-5365-0","10.1109/SysCon47679.2020.9275661","U.S. Department of Defense; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9275661","Digital Engineering;competency model;framework Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);acquisition workforce","Modeling;US Department of Defense;Task analysis;Data models;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Psychology","educational courses;engineering education;organisational aspects;software engineering;systems engineering","Digital Engineering Competency Framework;Systems Engineering Research Center;digital engineering models;digital engineering professionals;model-based systems engineering;Digital Engineering Positions;DECF;Defense Acquisition University curriculum;Department of Defense transitions","","2","","12","IEEE","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using a concurrent engineering process and interconnected analytical tools to estimate system size, mass, power, performance, resilience, and cost, engineers can rapidly develop concepts to perform feasibility assessments and configuration trade studies. Perhaps less clear is of the value of descriptive modeling offered by Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practice applied to concept design. Currently there are precious few examples of acquisition programs implementing MBSE across all life cycle phases, and fewer examples of programs that use it during concept development. Concept developers use analytical tools to analyze candidate systems during this phase, but they also need to deal with other aspects of system design such as mission objectives, system requirements, concept of operations, system architecture, and function allocation. These attributes may all be captured and interconnected in a descriptive system model, which is at the very core of MBSE practice. It is shown here how system developers can create and use such a descriptive system model in conjunction with their analytical concurrent engineering tools to rapidly develop concept designs.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741962","","Analytical models;Solid modeling;Tools;Satellites;Payloads","concurrent engineering;design engineering;systems engineering","concept design;analytical modeling;concurrent engineering process;system design;system requirements;system architecture;descriptive system model;analytical concurrent engineering tools;model based systems engineering","","2","","9","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, MBSE has also helped support NASA's Design-for-Reliability (DFR) and Mission Assurance activities. The utilization of MBSE helps visualize the development of the overall system in a digital environment. For the development of rocket propulsion systems, leveraging MBSE helps find ways to achieve reduction in costs, schedule, and risk throughout its life-cycle in a comprehensive and a cohesive manner. In order to deliver affordability in the competitive space race environment, it is important to reap the benefit of newer manufacturing technologies such as Additive Manufacturing (AM). In development of rocket propulsion systems, AM provides new design and performance opportunities for the rocket engine designs that is often complex. The fundamental advantage of an additively manufactured rocket propulsion element is the reduction in lead time and cost against traditional production techniques. AM designs help realize complex shapes and geometries that are often challenging and expensive to be produced using traditional production methodologies. In the context of a development of rocket propulsion system, AM provides the technological opportunity to realize newer engine designs that are technically and economically feasible. Significant efforts such as NASA's Additive Manufacturing Demonstrator Engine (AMDE) employ additive manufacturing in production of rocket propulsion engines. On the other hand, MBSE provides the ability to visualize the impact of a design change in a digital environment. Consequently, the objective of this study is to evaluate the benefits of leveraging MBSE suited to the context of additive manufactured rocket propulsion elements. A literature review is performed for the current state-of-the-art of additive manufactured rocket propulsion elements and potential opportunities to leverage MBSE has been identified. Furthermore, a design example (RS-25 or Space Shuttle Main Engine) has been explored to demonstrate the benefits of the research idea in this study. The choice of the design example is driven by the need to restart production of the engine for NASA's future launch manifests. Finally, the results of this study have been assessed qualitatively within the scope of reducing the time in Test-Fail-Fix (redesign, remanufacturing, retest, and recertification) cycle of the engine.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843586","","Rockets;Visualization;Additives;Costs;Shape;NASA;Space shuttles","aerospace instrumentation;aerospace propulsion;reliability;rocket engines;rockets;space vehicles;systems engineering","additive manufactured rocket propulsion elements;leverage MBSE;MBSE Utilization;Additive manufactured rocket propulsion components;Model Based Systems Engineering;Human-to-Mars In-Situ Resource Utilization;Space Launch System;support NASA's Design-for-Reliability;digital environment;rocket propulsion system;leveraging MBSE;newer manufacturing technologies;performance opportunities;rocket engine designs;additively manufactured rocket propulsion element;newer engine designs;NASA's Additive Manufacturing Demonstrator Engine;rocket propulsion engines","","","","41","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to iterative exchange loops between design participants in the early design stage and generates additional cost every time there is a modification. To overcome this issue, the integration of a system engineering approach hinged on set based concurrent engineering principles will reduce the exchange loops between engineers and optimize the use of time and resources. This approach is based on information flows: The upstream flow represents the exchange of information issued from system engineer to the different specialists, while the downstream flow serves as a feedback from the specialists to help system engineer in trade- off analysis. In this paper, a novel approach based on exchange flows is used to reduce the exchange loops between engineers. In the context of design for performance, system's constraints are introduced as key value attributes to evaluate trade-offs and to choose the best system architecture. Then, for each solution of the design space, the clustering phase is done through a developed algorithm to eliminate unfeasiule or costly solutions using filters like lead-time, production cost, quality, reliability and performance. Finally, a trade-off analysis is done to compare the reduced set of solutions. A case study concerning an electronic throttle body will be posed to illustrate various stages of this concurrent engineering approach.","","978-1-5386-2982-6","10.1109/MECATRONICS.2018.8495824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8495824","MBSE;mechatronic system;sBCE;sysML;trade-off analysis","Mechatronics;Object oriented modeling;Manufacturing;Adaptation models;Mathematical model","concurrent engineering;mechatronics;product development;production engineering computing;systems engineering","mechatronic system design;model-based systems engineering;upstream design stage;rough part design;exchange loops;design participants;early design stage;set based concurrent engineering principles;upstream flow;system engineer;downstream flow;system architecture;design space;lead-time;reduced set;concurrent engineering approach","","4","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Small satellites are operationally challenging because subsystem functions are coupled and constrained by the limited available commodities (e.g. data, energy, and access times to ground resources). Furthermore, additional operational complexities arise because small satellite components are physically integrated, which may yield thermal or radio frequency interference. In this paper, we extend our initial Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) framework developed for a small satellite mission by demonstrating the ability to model different behaviors and scenarios. We integrate several simulation tools to execute SysML-based behavior models, including subsystem functions and internal states of the spacecraft. We demonstrate utility of this approach to drive the system analysis and design process. We demonstrate applicability of the simulation environment to capture realistic satellite operational scenarios, which include energy collection, the data acquisition, and downloading to ground stations. The integrated modeling environment enables users to extract feasibility, performance, and robustness metrics. This enables visualization of both the physical states (e.g. position, attitude) and functional states (e.g. operating points of various subsystems) of the satellite for representative mission scenarios. The modeling approach presented in this paper offers satellite designers and operators the opportunity to assess the feasibility of vehicle and network parameters, as well as the feasibility of operational schedules. This will enable future missions to benefit from using these models throughout the full design, test, and fly cycle. In particular, vehicle and network parameters and schedules can be verified prior to being implemented, during mission operations, and can also be updated in near real-time with operational performance feedback.","1095-323X","978-1-4673-1813-6","10.1109/AERO.2013.6496894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496894","","Analytical models;Satellites;Earth;Biological system modeling;Industries;Visualization;Training","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;interference suppression;radiofrequency interference;satellite ground stations;scheduling;simulation languages;systems engineering","model based system engineering;Radio Aurora Explorer;CubeSat mission operational scenario;satellite component;operational complexity;radio frequency interference;thermal interference;SysML-based behavior models;subsystem functions;spacecraft;energy collection;data acquisition;ground station;network parameter;space vehicle;operational schedule;operational performance feedback","","26","","11","IEEE","13 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software.

The synergistic aspect of mechatronic systems makes their design challenging to take into account all the interactions among components of different domains. The safety-critical aspect of these systems implies rigorous safety analyses during the design. Consequently, designing such complex systems implies new tools and methodologies to manage the complexity and safety concerns while keeping within short time-to-market and budget constraints. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) turn out to be compulsory for the design and safety assessment of complex mechatronic systems. However, they need to be integrated efficiently during the design process to avoid costly late design changes. In order to perform consistent and exhaustive system modeling and safety analysis of safety-critical mechatronic systems, the system model shall be extended to include additional information helping in the generation of safety artifacts. In this paper, we propose some SysML extensions to better model mechatronics specificities such as interconnection components and multi-physical interactions, as well as some safety aspects for a better integration of MBSE and MBSA.

For example redevelopment projects that are undertaken to improve sustainability and resilience of urban built infrastructure do not often take into account the livelihoods of the resident population as formal design parameters unless the “mental models” of key stakeholders can relate the physical and human aspects together. Few people have the experience, system understanding, and influence to maintain these relationships throughout the system lifecycle. We would like to formally capture these mental models, but we lack the tools to successfully integrate the quantitative and verifiable physical infrastructure design models with the more qualitative social models that must be evaluated over time. This paper discusses the development of a design tool framework and an associated use case that combines qualitative evaluation and quantitative design aspects of a complex system into a common model-based systems engineering (MBSE) environment. This allows us to develop several new systems engineering paradigms: definition of “system constructs” that represent aggregation of combined physical and social design parameters; representation of multiple contexts in the design artifacts; formal capture of system level conceptual design into a common knowledge environment; and collaborative design tools that span multiple disciplines and differing abstraction levels. The OpenSEAT initiative is utilizing emerging research on software and systems-of-systems engineering methods and tools to design a modeling and simulation framework for data analysis and decision support in such complex sociotechnical systems. The framework supports conceptual models that capture the qualitative analysis of emerging sociotechnical systems and phenomena, which are then used to inform analytical models that can be used to analyze relevant objective measures and relationships of a design in operational use. Many aspects of the tool framework are mature, but projects using the tool framework to actually merge quantitative and qualitative analysis are currently in the conceptual design phases. One current project is developing a novel model representing human capital development in association with emerging technological systems development. The human capital model is then represented in a design tradespace that addresses both physical and social aspects of sustainable and resilient communities.","","978-1-4799-1920-8","10.1109/SysEng.2015.7302794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302794","Multi-level modeling;Sociotechnical systems;Complex adaptive systems;Model-based Systems Engineering;Systemigram;Soft systems;Emergence;Emergent patterns;Resilience;Human Capital","Context;Analytical models;Resilience;Data models;Object oriented modeling;Brain modeling","data analysis;social sciences computing;software tools;systems analysis;systems engineering","OpenSEAT;computer framework;qualitative evaluation;quantitative design aspects;complex sociotechnical systems;wicked problems;redevelopment projects;sustainability;urban built infrastructure;mental models;system understanding;system lifecycle;physical infrastructure design models;qualitative social models;design tool framework development;use case;model-based systems engineering;MBSE environment;system constructs;physical design parameters;social design parameters;design artifacts;system level conceptual design;knowledge environment;collaborative design tools;abstraction levels;systems-of-systems engineering methods;modeling framework;simulation framework;data analysis;decision support;technological systems development;human capital model;design tradespace;sustainable communities;resilient communities","","1","","23","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been heralded as a potential solution to streamline the process by supporting exploration of numerous parallel variants within a common multidimensional model. Successful decoupling of variants from their surroundings supports the parallel development of interfacing systems without delay or impediment, thereby permitting the deferment of a final decision on the preferred technology choice. Still, a number of challenges remain. Some have been addressed by previous research, though, not focusing on the effect of variant technology choices in the logical tier, nor on embedding variant management as a native part of the core MBSE model. This paper addresses those challenges via application of Liskov's Substitution Principle (LSP). It defines an MBSE based approach that explicitly documents variance points, identifying their source and scope, and integrates their management into the standard Systems Engineering (SE) workflow. Emphasis is given on providing a pragmatic approach that promotes consistency, visibility, and simplicity. The result is a model that embeds the required information artifacts without adding significant complexity. The proposed strategy does not prescribe excessive variant-specific activities, with the majority of the effort being already part of standard Requirement, Interface, and Logical SE processes. It is tolerant to an iterative approach, and proactively supports concurrent engineering through decoupling.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753166","Design alternatives engineering;variant management;decision deferral;choice modeling;technology-driven change management;MBSE;SysML;configuration management;information engineering;LSP","Drones;Modeling;Context;Complexity theory;Standards;System analysis and design","computational complexity;concurrent engineering;iterative methods;systems engineering","document variance points;concurrent engineering;iterative approach;logical SE processes;variant-specific activities;standard system engineering workflow;Liskov substitution principle;MBSE model;logical tier;multidimensional model;LSP;complexity reduction;cost reduction;model-based systems engineering","","1","","16","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An important task of this procedure is to find ideas for new product features based on an existing reference product. In industrial practice, usually technical models of the reference product (e.g. CAD models) are employed in the scope of product feature ideation. However, these models alone do not provide sufficient information for the identification of new Internet of Things (IoT) features. These features require the consideration of the available flows, the utilized communication technologies, and the surrounding System of Systems (SoS). A potential solution for this problem is provided by Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). MBSE provides a holistic system model that describes the logical architecture as well as the environment of the reference product. However, there is a lack of methodological support for the utilization of system models in the scope of strategic product planning. This paper presents a novel method for IoT feature ideation based on the system model of a reference product. The core of this method is the so-called IoT canvas, which constitutes an IoT-specific view on the system model of the reference product. It can be systematically derived from the system model and serves as the starting point for product feature ideation. The presented method was evaluated in the scope of an innovation project with a German manufacturing company and showed high potential for industrial practice.","","978-1-5386-4876-6","10.1109/SYSOSE.2018.8428722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428722","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Product Generation Engineering PGE;Cyber-Physical Systems CPS;Industry 4.0;Fuzzy front-end;Early phase of innovation process;Release planning;Innovation management;Advanced Systems Engineering;Workshop approach;Methodology;Product planning","Unified modeling language;Solid modeling;Planning;Production systems;Printing","Internet;Internet of Things;manufacturing industries;production engineering computing;production planning;strategic planning;systems engineering","product feature ideation;Model-Based Systems Engineering;holistic system model;strategic product planning;IoT feature ideation;Model-Based product generation planning;reference product;Internet of Things features;logical architecture;IoT canvas;German manufacturing company","","1","","27","IEEE","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity of those systems which are fundamentally different from those of the last decades in their own areas and are furthermore growing. To fulfil all requirements in those fields, a wider range of functionalities and components are needed, especially for IoT systems. In the interdisciplinary development, many conflicts occur. Thus, the complexity of the product demands a change of the development process itself. Most approaches lack in aspects of transparency, traceability and continuous development in general. Therefore, a neutral systematic approach is needed, which model-based systems engineering (MBSE) could provide. This paper applied MBSE in the domain of IoT in WSN development. Although MBSE emerged from system engineering/development, it essentially allows any developer in any discipline to understand relations between different system components in the central system model. The stages of this research are not fully developed yet but a high potential is expected. This holistic central system model is described by MBSE with tool, modelling language and method. The most promising modelling language for an interdisciplinary work in a real industrial content is SysML, which will be applied throughout the modelling tool following the RFLP principle of the V-model. These endeavours will then represent our result to show a more transparent continuous traceable solution in comparison with the existing application.","","978-1-5386-4446-1","10.1109/SysEng.2018.8544420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8544420","MBSE;SysML;IoT;WSN;V-Model;RFLP;Cameo System Modeler","Peer-to-peer computing;Wireless sensor networks;Modeling;Unified modeling language;Tools;Network topology","Internet of Things;systems engineering;wireless sensor networks","IoT systems;interdisciplinary development;continuous development;neutral systematic approach;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;WSN development;holistic central system model;V-model;transparent continuous traceable solution;wireless sensor networks;low powered wireless IoT sensor network;RFLP principle","","2","","36","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system modeling language standard, SysML is designed to create MBSE supporting models. However, SysML itself is not practical enough to be used for real-world engineering projects. As SysML is designed for generic systems and requires specialized knowledge, a model written in SysML has a limited capability to support communication between a systems engineer and a subsystem engineer. Our research's main goal is to develop a SysML based plant model integrating most outputs from plant design phases. As mentioned, a standard SysML based plant model is not specific enough to be understood by plant engineers. To make the SysML model more practical, a customized SysML for the plant engineering domain is required. Unfortunately, current researches on SysML Domain Specific Language(DSL) for the plant engineering industry are still on the early stage. So, as a pilot, we have developed our own SysML-based Piping & Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) creation environment and P&ID itself for a specific plant system, via widely known SysML modeling tool called MagicDraw. P&ID is one of the most important output during the plant design phase, which contains all information for the plant construction phase. So a SysML based P&ID has a great potential to bridge gaps between plant engineers.","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088289","MBSE;SysML;SysML Domain Specific Language;P&ID","Unified modeling language;Mathematical model;DSL;Solid modeling;Standards;Prototypes","SysML","SysML domain specific language;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;DSL;MagicDraw","","","","6","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Treating interoperability infrastructure as a system in its own right, MoBIE facilitates interoperability among agents, processes, systems, services, and interfaces. MoBIE is founded on ISO 19450 standard-object-process methodology, a holistic paradigm for modeling and architecting complex, dynamic, and multidisciplinary systems-and allows for synergistic integration of the interoperability model with system-centric models. We also discuss the implementation of MoBIE with the unified modeling language. We discuss the importance of interoperability in the civil aviation domain, and apply MoBIE to analyze the passenger departure process in an airport terminal as a case-in-point. The resulting model enables architectural and operational decision making and analysis at the system-of-systems level and adds significant value at the interoperability engineering program level.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2602543","Gordon Center for Systems Engineering at the Technion—Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7571127","Airport terminals;interoperability;model-based systems engineering (MBSE);object process methodology (OPM);systems-of-systems (SoS)","Interoperability;Unified modeling language;Atmospheric modeling;Business;Ontologies","airports;avionics;decision making;formal specification;object-oriented programming;open systems;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","interoperability engineering program level;systems-of-systems;conceptual modeling framework;MoBIE;multilayered interoperability specification;interoperability model;system-centric models;unified modeling language;civil aviation domain;model-based systems engineering;model-based interoperability engineering;object-process methodology;passenger departure process analysis;decision making","","21","","49","IEEE","19 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, to develop current or future Electric Vehicles (EV) is challenging due to different domains to consider while engineering the sub-components of the vehicle itself. Thus, in order to enable a mutual development of vehicular embedded systems on multiple abstraction levels, the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES) has been introduced. To cope with the complexity, this framework introduces viewpoints and hierarchy layers in shape of a matrix. However, while additionally multiple domains have to be considered when developing an EV, the SPES methodology is also missing specifications, impeding its application in actual industrial scenarios. To deal with both of the mentioned issues, this paper introduces an approach for Model-based Systems Engineering of electric vehicle systems based on SPES. By doing so, this framework is further refined by an architecture definition based on the ISO 42010 and a corresponding development process. By utilizing the EV use case, the outcome is thereby validated towards its industrial feasibility, which will enhance the applicability of SPES on the one hand and contribute to the Automotive area by dealing with the increasing complexity while engineering vehicular embedded systems on the other hand.","","978-1-7281-2989-1","10.1109/ETFA45728.2021.9613405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9613405","System Architecture;ISO 42010;Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES);Electric Vehicle Charging;Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE)","Embedded systems;Shape;ISO Standards;Computer architecture;Electric vehicles;Software;Complexity theory","cyber-physical systems;electric vehicles;matrix algebra;power engineering computing;software engineering;systems engineering","automation potentials;vehicle development;EV;mutual development;multiple abstraction levels;software platform embedded systems;SPES;model-based systems engineering;electric vehicle systems;engineering vehicular embedded systems;cross-domain embedded vehicle engineering;system-of-systems architecture definition;matrix;cyber-physical systems","","1","","24","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To manage the rising complexity of cyber-physical systems, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has become a powerful approach. In MBSE systems can be abstracted by four system levels: (1) Requirements, (2) Functions, (3) Solutions and (4) Product. Each of these levels may provide alternatives to the system. The entire collection of alternatives within the solution-level (3) forms the solution-space and provides any possible solution of a system or a subsystem. Due to the dependencies between requirements, functions and solutions, to develop the entire possible solution-space of a system, the alternatives of each system level have to be combined. By analysing this entire solution-space and determining the global optimum regarding a certain indicator, e.g. cost, weight or sustainability, innovations can be achieved. Due to the high complexity of modern systems, the number of alternative systems is enormous and the identification of all alternatives is an extensive work as no alternative should be missed for a complete evaluation. Generative Engineering (GE) is an engineering approach that generates all possible alternatives of a specified system automatically. This paper will evaluate the capability of using GE to identify alternatives in systems, which are developed with the approaches of MBSE. It focuses on the generation of alternatives in the layer of functions and in the layer of solutions. The presented approach shall save a lot of time in the process of identifying alternatives in order to create a complete solutions space. This might help in the identification of global optimums and innovations.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-8182-3","10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005535","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Alternatives;Generative Engineering","Technological innovation;Costs;Companies;Cyber-physical systems;Germanium;Complexity theory;Modeling","systems engineering","complex systems;cyber-physical systems;GE;generative engineering approach;MBSE systems;model-based system engineering approach","","","","23","IEEE","10 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system's current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today's systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle. This paper also presents preliminary results from prototyping and experiments conducted with a digital twin that is continuously updated with data from the physical system operating in the real world. Finally, this paper shows how operational analysis and system modeling can be significantly enhanced by leveraging digital twin technology within MBSE.","2577-1655","978-1-6654-4207-7","10.1109/SMC52423.2021.9658769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9658769","","Digital twin;Program management;Supply chains;Organizations;Systems modeling;Stakeholders;Risk management","investment;prototypes;supply chain management;systems engineering","MBSE;model-based systems engineering;systems life cycle;continuous model updates;physical system;traditional systems engineering organizations;investment;defect detection;risk reduction;improved communication;superior supply chain integration;prototyping;leveraging digital twin technology","","3","","34","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to guarantee precise, consistent and correct models, there is an urgent need for efficient reasoning methods for verifying model correctness. This paper extends and strengthens our previous work on efficient recognition of finite satisfiability problems in UML class diagrams with constrained generalization sets. First, algorithm FiniteSat is simplified into a single stage process, yielding a more compact linear inequality system. The main contribution of the paper is a method for propagation of disjoint constraints within complex class hierarchy structures, which meaningfully extends the scope of the FiniteSat algorithm. The method relies on a thorough analysis of the interaction between disjoint constraints and the structure of class hierarchy. It is recommended as a pre-processing stage, and being an anytime algorithm, even partial application is useful.","","978-1-4244-2967-7","10.1109/MBSE.2009.5031714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5031714","","Unified modeling language","computability;program verification;reasoning about programs;Unified Modeling Language","finite satisfiability recognition;UML class diagram;disjoint constraint propagation;model-driven engineering;linear inequality system;complex class hierarchy structure;FiniteSat algorithm;reasoning method;model correctness verification","","6","","16","IEEE","29 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most traditional business process modeling (BPM) methods lack enough flexibility. It is hard to extract and reuse information and knowledge embedded in the existing business process models to build new models. We propose an algebraic framework based on a many-sorted algebra, algebra of system (AoS), to achieve the flexibility in business process modeling. We decompose business process models into different modules of knowledge and encode them as different algebraic domains of AoS. Within each algebraic domain, knowledge is encoded as operands. Based on operands, each algebraic domain is equipped with operators to provide computation capabilities. The operands and operators ensure the flexibility that the framework can achieve and the analysis capabilities that the framework can provide.","","978-1-4244-2967-7","10.1109/MBSE.2009.5031720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5031720","","Algebra;Companies;Data structures;Computational modeling;Industrial engineering;Collaboration;Dictionaries;Data mining;Information analysis;Knowledge engineering","business data processing;process algebra","business process modeling;algebraic language;algebra of system","","1","","13","IEEE","29 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The simulation of the system model is instrumental in understanding and exploring the behavioral aspects of the system under study and uncovering logical and conceptual problems, such as incorrect control flow and missing structural relations among objects. The latter is achieved via an intuitive user interface and a host of debugging capabilities, including ldquolifespanrdquo and ldquoDebug Infordquo components.

The rate of change poses a significant dilemma to stakeholders regarding the amount of effort and resources they should invest in methodological practices, including modeling, design, analysis, and specification. The attempt to move quickly from concept to operation often leads to preference of expedience for gaining early time-to-market over quality and robustness. Rather than referring to the modeling vs. agility challenge as a dilemma, we perceive it as an opportunity for synergy. Building on Object-Process Methodology (OPM)-the new ISO-19450 standard, we propose an agile model-based systems engineering (MBSE) framework that facilitates, and fosters development agility and system evolution. This agile MBSE framework extends the traditional scope of system modeling to cover aspects of functional and structural evolution, phase transition, deployment feedback, and configuration interdependence. We demonstrate the applicability of agile MBSE on a hypothetical ballistic missile defense system, based on publicly available information on Iron Dome - an Israeli ballistic missile defense system with proven operational capability.","","978-1-4799-5927-3","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116855","Agile Model-Based Systems Engineering;Evolving System Models;Agile Development;Object-Process Methodology;Configuration Management;Ballistic Missile Defense","Modeling;Missiles;Iron;Unified modeling language;Planning;Biological system modeling","defence industry;ISO standards;military computing;missiles;systems engineering;time to market","agile modeling;object-process methodology;agile development;time-to-market;robustness;OPM;ISO-19450 standard;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;system modeling;iron dome;Israeli ballistic missile defense system","","8","","29","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various tools are integrated into the co-simulation environment to execute the simulation. The main goal is to simulate different communication types, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), so several scenarios are created to simulate V2X communication. In Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO), simulations are performed for the given scenarios which are based on model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. Controllers are built in Simulink and used to control vehicles in SUMO, while Virtual Test Drive (VTD) is used to visualize the simulation in a 3D environment. Model.CONNECT™ is used to run each of these several tools simultaneously. MBSE section of this paper addresses the first major steps of system specification which are use case generation and requirement elicitation.

In addition, the validation process is requirement analysis, functional architecture design, scheme design, and dynamic management validation. The AST system can help the implementation of MBSE in the field of aircraft design.

The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) established the MBSE Initiative to promote, advance, and institutionalize the practice of MBSE. As part of this effort, the INCOSE Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) Challenge Team has been investigating the applicability of MBSE for designing CubeSats since 2011. The goal of the team is to provide a sufficiently complete CubeSat Reference Model that can be adapted to any CubeSat project. The INCOSE Systems Engineering Vision 2020 defines MBSE as “the formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases.” At the core of MBSE is the development of the system model that helps integrate other discipline-specific engineering models and simulations. The team has been creating this system model by capturing all aspects of a CubeSat project using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is a graphical modeling language for systems engineering. SysML diagrams are used to describe requirements, structures, behaviors, and parametrics from the system level down to the component level. Requirements and design are contained in the model rather than in a series of independent engineering artifacts. In the past three phases of the project, the team has created the initial iteration of the reference model, applied it to the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX) mission, executed simulations of system behaviors, interfaced with commercial simulation tools, and demonstrated how behaviors and constraint equations can be executed to perform operational trade studies. The modeling effort starts anew in this fourth phase. The CubeSat Reference Model starts with an identification of potential stakeholders. A stakeholder is any entity that has an interest in the system including sponsor, end user, procurer, supplier, and regulatory agencies. The each stakeholder's needs, objectives, constraints, and measures of effectiveness are incorporated in the model. Constraints are those items fixed and not subject to trades such as mission budget and schedule. One of the stakeholders is the Cal Poly CubeSat project. The Cal Poly CubeSat Specification has been populated into its own SysML model to enable the content of the specification to be related to the CubeSat Reference Model. The CubeSat mission enterprise consists of the space system, ground system, launch services, launch vehicle interface system, and communication services. Since the reference model is being developed by a team effort, there is an obligation to protect the investment of time and knowledge of each team member. There also needs to be a licensing environment that is conducive to a user organization supporting the development of and use of the model. There will be a license that allows for non-commercial use and prohibits incorporating the model or model features into a commercial product.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500592","","Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language;Adaptation models;Stakeholders;Analytical models","aerospace computing;aerospace engineering;artificial satellites;diagrams;formal specification;formal verification;SysML;systems analysis;systems engineering","SysML diagram;Systems Modeling Language;system verification;system analysis;system design;system requirement;SSWG;space systems working group;International Council on Systems Engineering INCOSE;MBSE;model-based system engineering;CubeSat reference model","","9","","17","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A significant, expected benefit from MBSE is a reduction in the time commitment for all aspects of systems engineering. Although advances in MBSE have occurred, a gap has emerged between the traditional configuration management (CM) processes for documents and those needed in an MBSE environment. MBSE is a tool to support systems engineers in requirements, design, analysis, verification, and validation activities from concept phase throughout the life cycle of the project. MBSE is not a new process being added to the existing SE processes, but captures the data that systems engineers create into a single environment. Systems engineers working in an MBSE environment have become more efficient and produce a higher resolution of data because elements representing the system of interest are placed within a single construct where requirements, architecture (physical & logical), and concept of operation scenarios are all related to one another. Historically, systems engineers capture and track system information through the generation of documents, drawings, and other artifacts, which are released, baselined, and governed by a document-centric CM process. The work required to maintain and distribute documents throughout the system life cycle using the traditional CM processes is a time-consuming task for both systems engineers and CM practitioners alike. The MBSE environment requires adaption of traditional CM processes or the creation of entirely new CM approaches in order to 1) manage the MBSE model output in data or documents and 2) perform CM within the actual digital model. Systems engineers and CM personnel from the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) Project at NASA Glenn Research Center have developed and are continually improving a method for baselining and configuration-managing technical content within the PPE MBSE model(s). This paper describes the process of defining how to configuration manage not just the artifacts but the requirements, verifications, and functional decomposition of an MBSE model for an evolving project. The paper also presents the results of trial and error testing, required adjustments to CM processes, and lessons learned from developing CM processes for the PPE system-level requirements and generating procurement artifacts. While developed for the MBSE environment, these processes still address standard CM activities such as protecting NASA-sensitive and partner proprietary information, baselining content, processing change requests, and providing configuration status accounting.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172375","","","aerospace computing;aerospace propulsion;configuration management;mechanical engineering computing;system documentation;systems engineering","MBSE environment;systems engineers capture;track system information;system life cycle;MBSE model output;PPE MBSE model;PPE system-level requirements;generating procurement artifacts;systems engineering;Propulsion Element MBSE Model","","2","","2","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This trend brings great opportunities for manufacturing companies, but also inherits challenges to overcome. Resulting from this, a heterogeneous tool-landscape has emerged, where each of the single tools is addressing a particular aspect of the value-creation network. An example for such a tool specifically targeting the engineering of such flexible production systems according to the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) has been proposed with the RAMI Toolbox. However, as universal frameworks are too general to deal with all aspects of developing such complex systems, other possibilities for conflictfree engineering of the system need to be available. Thus, the main contribution of this paper deals with proposing a Round-trip Engineering (RTE) approach, that allows to export previously modeled flexible production systems according to the peculiarities of RAMI 4.0 and subsequently reload external elaborated results. Thereby, a major benefit is the application of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), which ensures the traceability to the remaining system components. The chosen methodology for bidirectionally exchanging the engineering data is AutomationML, which allows to store exported information from RAMI 4.0 or import such stored information into it. The RTE-approach is thereby evaluated with a real-world case study, the Siemens Fischertechnik industrial plant model.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921425","Siemens; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921425","Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);AutomationML;Round-trip Engineering (RTE)","Industries;Production systems;Three-dimensional printing;Market research;Manufacturing;Industrial plants;Internet of Things","control engineering computing;industrial plants;manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;systems engineering","remaining system components;engineering data;AutomationML;RAMI 4;Siemens Fischertechnik industrial plant model;complex production Systems;product configurations;future production systems;manufacturing companies;heterogeneous tool-landscape;single tools;particular aspect;value-creation network;Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4;universal frameworks;complex systems;conflictfree engineering;system need;Round-trip Engineering approach;modeled flexible production systems;external elaborated results;Model-based Systems Engineering","","","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Broodney","Systems Engineering Technologies, IBM Research, Haifa, Israel; Systems Engineering Technologies, IBM Research, Haifa, Israel","2015 Annual IEEE Systems Conference (SysCon) Proceedings","4 Jun 2015","2015","","","77","83","In model-based systems engineering, systems are built as models. Models are abstractions, since they are not the real physical parts, but a data representation of then in a computer. As such, it is tempting to establish a methodology and a system in which models can be shared among projects. When an engineer creates new models of components in a new project, her past experience in making similar components, as well as that of her colleagues, can be easily reused since no physical limitations get in the way. Models in our case are actually mathematical equations. Yet, the wide variety of design tools makes it difficult to take an existing component model created in one tool and reuse it in another. This problem is often classified as `tools interoperability' where models need to be shared among tools. Scenarios which give rise to such needs occur when teams collaborate on the same project, but belong to different organizations or different disciplines. Yet, the advantage of reuse is very obvious and presents a certain use case for interoperability. Our scenario would be a systems engineering organization that needs to support reuse in its design work. Our use-case would be different than the problem of product-lines. There, components are designed for ease of customization to match different, but similar requirements, while sharing one source that can be varied towards multiple different outcomes. Here, reuse can be applied too over a design for a product-line. Internet of Things (IoT) and design patterns will be looked at as well to be proper candidates to benefit from the approach to reuse as will be presented in this paper.","","978-1-4799-5927-3","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116732","mbse;reuse;modeling;catalogues;systems engineering","Ontologies;Mediation;Resource description framework;Semantics;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling","data structures;Internet of Things;model-based reasoning;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;systems engineering","model-based system engineering;data representation;mathematical equation;design tool;Internet of Things;IoT","","8","","30","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is the level of system of systems. At this level similar standardized model- based approaches are used to capture knowledge; however, most analysis is far from being standards based.

A similar approach exists for the automotive domain: the Automotive Reference Architecture Model (ARAM) framework. As opposed to other automotive frameworks, this one offers interoperability with the smart grid framework, which simplifies cross-domain collaboration. During the development of ARAM, the Software Platform Embedded Systems (SPES) methodology gained momentum. This methodology can be considered an architectural model while the automotive framework can be considered an analysis model, according to the domain-specific systems engineering approach. In order to follow this approach, a transformation between the two models must be possible.

MBSE creates a system model that helps integrate other discipline specific engineering models and simulations. The system level model is initiated at the start of a project and evolves throughout development. It provides a cohesive and consistent source of system requirements, design, analysis, and verification. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) established the Space Systems MBSE Challenge team in 2007. The SSWG Challenge team has been investigating the applicability of MBSE for designing CubeSats since 2011. Our application of MBSE uses System Modeling Language (SysML), a graphical modeling language. SysML is used to model all aspects of a system either directly or through an interface with another model. SysML diagrams are used to describe requirements, structures, behaviors, and parametrics from the system down to the component level. The first phase of SSWG CubeSat project created a CubeSat reference model that was applied to the Radio Aurora Explorer (RAX), a three-unit CubeSat developed by SRI International and the Michigan Exploration Laboratory at the University of Michigan. The second phase focused on expanding the RAX CubeSat model to include modeling behaviors and interfacing with several Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) simulation tools. The third phase was comprised of two activities. The first was the development of a CubeSat Enterprise Model to capture cost and product Iifecycle aspects for the mission spacecraft and problem domain. The second activity incorporated additional design and operational characteristics into the RAX model. The modeling effort starts anew in this fourth phase and has two objectives: 1) Develop a CubeSat Reference Model that other projects can use as a starting point for their mission specific CubeSat model. The space and ground systems, subsystems, and components are being modeled throughout the entire project Iifecycle. 2)Develop a CubeSat Project Model that models how CubeSat design and development are to be accomplished. The first objective is in response to: ""Model-based systems enj!ineerinj! (MBSE) is the formalized application of modelinj! to support system requirements, desij!n, analysis, verification and validation activities bej!inninj! in the conceptual desij!n phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases."" The second objective is in response to: ""A MBSE methodology is a collection of related processes, methods, and tools used to support the discipline of systems engineering in a 'modelbased' or 'model-driven' context."" The effort to date has been focused on establishing nomenclature; the incorporation of the stakeholders and their needs, objectives, measures of effectiveness; and the architecture down to the logical subsystems. The next step is to determine the level of model definition at each of the Iifecycle stages and to create models for the concept and development phases. The CubeSat Reference Model will be rolled-out in a controlled fashion to make certain that model is understandable and useful. The requests and applications of the model have fallen into two categories: 1) Using the model within an aerospace engineering course and 2) evaluating the application of MBSE within an aerospace program.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-5380-6","10.1109/AERO.2015.7118965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118965","","Unified modeling language;Biological system modeling;Industries;Group technology;Analytical models;Biographies;Satellites","aerospace computing;formal verification;SysML;systems engineering;visual languages","CubeSat project model;CubeSat design;system requirements;system analysis activities;system validation activities;system verification activities;MBSE methodology;model-based context;model-driven context;aerospace engineering course;aerospace program;space systems;ground systems;product Iifecycle aspects;CubeSat enterprise model;COTS simulation tools;commercial off the shelf simulation tools;RAX CubeSat model;University of Michigan;Michigan Exploration Laboratory;SRI International;three-unit CubeSat;RAX;Radio Aurora Explorer;CubeSat reference model;SSWG CubeSat project;SysML diagrams;graphical modeling language;system modeling language;space system MBSE;Space System Working Group;INCOSE;International Council on Systems Engineering;CubeSat missions;CubeSat model-based system engineering reference model","","19","","20","IEEE","8 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While ontologies and patterns are absolutely necessary, an MBSE effort must also design and provide practical demonstration of value (through human-understandable representations of model data that address stakeholder concerns) or it will not succeed. This paper will discuss opportunities that exist for visualization in making the richness of a well-formed model accessible to stakeholders, specifically stakeholders who rely on the model for their day-to-day work. This paper will discuss the value added by MBSE-driven visualizations in the context of a small case study of interactive visualizations created and used on NASA's proposed Europa Mission. The case study visualizations were created for the purpose of understanding and exploring targeted aspects of requirements flow, allocation, and comparing the structure of that flow-down to a conceptual project decomposition.

The Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) will be integrated into a larger Mars Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) for transit to and storage on Mars. After all Martian samples have been collected and loaded into the MAV payload assembly, MAV will deliver the samples from the Martian surface to Mars orbit. A separate spacecraft, the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) will retrieve the samples from Mars orbit and return them to Earth. To address common systems engineering challenges associated with using traditional systems engineering practices on complex projects, the MAV systems engineering team has explored implementation of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools and languages. This paper describes the current state of implementation and development of the MAV MBSE model with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) within the scope of the MAV Systems Requirement Cycle (SRC) systems engineering workflow. The MAV MBSE model has been developed within Magic Draw – a SysML editor commonly used to implement MBSE. The MAV MBSE model has been used to develop mission phase functional flow diagrams for the Concept of Operations, decompose mission to vehicle subsystem functions, develop a functional decomposition, derive functional requirements, trace requirements up to customer-imposed requirements, trace requirements within MAV requirement space, identify requirements trace gaps, define and map the physical design space architecture, allocate requirements to subsystems, develop validation items, define assembly, integration, and test (AI&T) operations, and trace these items across driving goals to develop an integrated digital thread of systems engineering information used to drive design specifications, decision making, and ultimately design verification and validation.

Modern antenna measurement ranges employing multi-axis robotic positioners provide a near limitless degree of re-configurability in terms of measurement types and scan geometries. This drives an ongoing need to evaluate each unique setup and application. Model based Systems Engineering and development (MBSE/MBD) approaches can be employed to dramatically reduce the time, effort, and cost associated with the test development and validation phases of a given program.

The concept of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) appears to be a promising approach, even though the common paradigm of object modelling poses a challenge for stakeholders from different domains. To better enable stakeholder integration, in recent past the concept of Domain Specific Systems Engineering (DSSE) has been proposed. This concept aims at establishing a modelling approach around domain specific viewpoints and model kinds. The DSSE approach could have been validated in different domains so far. To enable the integration of systems from different domains into System-of-Systems (SoS), this paper contributes conceptual thoughts on how to extend the DSSE approach for application in System-of-Systems Engineering (SoSE). For this purpose, the paper first gives a brief summary on the core concepts of DSSE. Further, a case study is realized to learn about the needs and limitations when it comes to extending DSSE for System-of-Systems Engineering.

This paper describes how such challenges have been partly addressed by the Model-Based Systems Engineering Team (MSET) on the Europa Project at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), through the application of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) techniques. The paper first discusses the principle of Single-Source-of-Truth (SSoT) and how it can be supported by the use of a well-structured system model relying on a rich vocabulary (e.g., based on the SysML language). The application of modeling patterns to organize the Flight System design information and make it queryable is then examined, with specific examples used on the Europa project (such as launch dry mass, electrical power, thermal power, fields-of-view). The benefits of checking formal rules to verify the correctness of the model and ensure that changes were properly incorporated are also discussed. The paper then presents model organization strategies that maximize the reuse of information across multiple design architectures that are explored in early formulation, as well as various practices used to control the numerous changes made to the model as the design matures. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the lessons learned from using a system model on the Europa project in order to capture design information about the Flight System. This has proved to play a key role in delivering high-quality representations of the spacecraft design to a variety of stakeholders as well as demonstrating its viability.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500604","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500604","","Modeling;Propulsion;System analysis and design;Unified modeling language;Aerospace electronics;Telecommunications","aerospace computing;formal verification;object-oriented programming;software architecture;systems engineering","flight system design modeling;Europa project;model-based systems engineering team;MSET;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;JPL;model-based systems engineering techniques;MBSE techniques;single-source-of-truth;SSoT;SysML language;modeling patterns;formal rules checking;correctness verification;model organization strategies;design architectures","","8","","14","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper summarizes the characteristics of the created SysML objects, able to represent Datum, Datum Reference Frame (DRF) and tolerance zones.

In previous work, industry focus groups have indicated that one way this can be achieved is by performing early functional validation of elements of the spacecraft avionics. This paper presents an extended approach, introduced in a case study previously published by the authors, to enable early functional analysis of a spacecraft. The approach uses the `Spacecraft Early Analysis Model' (SEAM), a SysML-based model framework for the definition, development and analysis of a space-based mission and corresponding space system. This formal model-based representation of the system enables the high-level simulation of the design during Phase B of the spacecraft system lifecycle. The SEAM pulls together different, traditionally disparate, analysis tools and enables them to work together, producing an integrated system model spanning multiple tools. It facilitates the simulation of the mission using dedicated orbit modelling software, analysis of the completeness and accuracy of the system behaviour, and provides an indication of the appropriate logical architecture. The SEAM has been developed iteratively by applying it to Earth-observation case studies from the Biomass mission, refining the capabilities of the template accordingly, and subsequently generalising the model. The resulting interim version of the Spacecraft Early Analysis Model contains a series of MBSE patterns that will ultimately provide users with a comprehensive and consistent SysML-based structure that enables early functional definition and analysis of spacecraft. Next steps in the development of the SEAM include its application to a wider variety of use cases to develop and demonstrate its versatility, and the development of metrics to measure its perceived value among practitioners.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172702","","","aerospace computing;avionics;formal specification;formal verification;project management;software engineering;space vehicles;systems engineering","SEAM;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Document-Based Systems Engineering;systems engineering projects;early functional analysis;SysML-based model framework;space-based mission;corresponding space system;formal model-based representation;spacecraft system lifecycle;integrated system model;orbit modelling software;system behaviour;Spacecraft Early Analysis Model;comprehensive SysML-based structure;consistent SysML-based structure;early functional definition","","","","38","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve this purpose, we tackled the following axes: 1) formalizing a SysML-based design methodology that will be the support for safety analyses; 2) providing an extension of SysML to enable the integration of specific needs for safety concepts in the system model; and 3) performing an automated exploration of the SysML models to generate necessary information to elaborate safety artifacts such as failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA).

Gaps in requirements formulation can lead to solutions that are not fitfor-purpose. However, the completeness of a set of requirements cannot be demonstrated; rather, completeness is an attempt, a best-effort pursuit. In current practice, where requirement gaps are frequent in system development, the human (engineer or team of engineers) becomes a major factor in the comprehensiveness of the resulting set of requirements. In this paper, we present a concept of an intelligent systems engineering (SE) advisor that supports the (human) engineer in identifying gaps as requirements are formulated, the set of structural rules that the intelligent SE advisor uses to perform the assessment, and a proof-of-concept implemented as a plugin for a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) software environment. The proposed intelligent SE advisor evaluates requirements that are formulated in the form of models leveraging a knowledge repository to read the model-based requirements. If potential gaps in the set of requirements are identified, these are presented to the engineer, who decides how to address the gaps. In this way, the intelligent SE advisor contributes to assessing requirements validation, beyond simply verifying model construction.","2577-1655","978-1-7281-8526-2","10.1109/SMC42975.2020.9283466","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283466","intelligent advisor;systems engineering advisor;cognitive advisor;requirements engineering;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;model-based requirements","Knowledge engineering;Analytical models;Syntactics;Systems Modeling Language;Software;Requirements engineering;Intelligent systems","formal specification;knowledge based systems;software maintenance;SysML;systems analysis;systems engineering","acceptable solutions;requirements formulation;requirement gaps;system development;resulting set;intelligent systems engineering advisor;structural rules;intelligent SE advisor;model-based requirements;potential gaps;assessing requirements validation;intelligent advisor;requirements gaps;engineering team;systems modeling language software environment","","","","33","IEEE","14 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, system models do not stand for themselves - rather, they are related to a multitude of engineering documents such as requirements specification documents, CAD drawings or electric circuit diagrams. Especially for practical applications, it is therefore essential to couple system models with such engineering documents. As a basis to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a concept for coupling models and documents in automated production systems at the example of requirements engineering models. The concept envisions an automatic generation process from such models to textual Functional Specification Documents (FSDs), which are often used throughout negotiation between manufacturers and customers. Changes to such FSDs, e.g. made via PDF annotation tools, are then propagated back to the respective models. We envision the concept to be a basis for future extensions that aim at improving current MBSE approaches to make them more productive and attractive for practical applications during engineering of automated production systems.","","978-1-5090-5320-9","10.1109/ICIT.2017.7915529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7915529","Automated Production Systems;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Model-Document Coupling","Solid modeling;Unified modeling language;Object oriented modeling;Couplings;Integrated circuit modeling;Requirements engineering","CAD;factory automation;production engineering computing;SysML;systems engineering","aPS engineering;model-based systems engineering;model-document coupling;CAD;functional specification documents;PDF annotation;automated production systems","","5","","23","IEEE","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is often unclear which information is available and its quality is questionable especially due to document based information handling. Inconsistencies, redundancies and discipline specific documents are reasons for that. The problem increases in the early design stages as information is mostly available within presentations, which are not self-explanatory, or in employees' minds. Several tools aim to solve this problem but have their strength in later stages of the development or are just focusing single activities - mainly technical issues. On the other hand there is a trend to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE): is a promising approach for the improvement of interdisciplinary collaboration in product development. It suggests a system model (instead of a database as for PDM) as single source of “truth” for product and project specific information - according to its basic concept Systems Engineering. Up to now, enterprises struggle implementing a holistic MBSE. It is often unclear which information is needed in which models at what time by whom. This can cause `modeling for its own sake'. MBSE may contribute to the improvement of information handling and information quality. To enable this, we propose a workflow-based concept to support information handling using MBSE already at the early phase of product engineering. The concept offers the potential to significantly ease access to information, reduce the time for searching of information and brings the breakthrough for MBSE as it connects engineering and process activities.","","978-1-5090-0793-6","10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753141","Systems Engineering;MBSE;Information Handling;Workflow","Modeling;Unified modeling language;Market research;Production;Mechatronics;Complexity theory","information management;product development;product quality;systems engineering","MBSE;workflow management system;product engineering;information management;information handling;model-based system engineering;interdisciplinary collaboration improvement;product development;information quality improvement","","4","","37","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Miotto","Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA; Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA","2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference","19 Jun 2014","2014","","","1","10","Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is intended to enhance productivity and quality through a paradigm shift from document-centric engineering. However, most MBSE development tools require the manual creation of requirement constructs. This time consuming step is vulnerable to human error, and must be repeated as high-level designs inevitably evolve. This paper describes a capability that uses SysML structure and behavior diagrams to automatically generate textual requirements. Using modified off-the-shelf MBSE software, information is extracted from SysML constructs (e.g., blocks, states, activities) and combined in SysML requirement objects. The requirement syntax conforms to NASA and DoD standards. Requirements are based on SysML construct relationships (e.g., allocations, control flows, object flows) commonly used in diagrams to describe system architectures and designs. Through the embedded error checker, designers can ensure that requirements are complete and consistent. When new requirement constructs are created, traceability to the “parent” SysML constructs is automatically created to capture the rationale. As the architectural models evolve, the requirements are updated to ensure consistency with configuration management and other model-based tools. Such an approach allows designers to quickly assess the impact of requirement changes and reduces requirement management costs. The capability is demonstrated by comparing model generated requirements to a traditionally developed GPS receiver specification.","1095-323X","978-1-4799-1622-1","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836450","","Biological system modeling;Writing;Quality of service","aerospace computing;computational linguistics;configuration management;embedded systems;formal specification;formal verification;program diagnostics;software architecture;software development management;software tools;SysML;systems engineering;visual languages","model-based requirement generation;model-based systems engineering;MBSE development tools;high level design;SysML structure;behavior diagrams;automatic textual requirement generation;modified off-the-shelf MBSE software;requirement syntax;NASA standards;DoD standards;system design;embedded error checker;traceability;architectural model;configuration management;model-based tools;requirement management cost reduction","","8","","19","IEEE","19 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reduce the cycle of verification, validation and accreditation (VV&A) and increase the probability of successful design within fewest iterations, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) proposes a design information transferring methodology based on digital models, which extends the V model to double Vs model.

Fundamental to this Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach, eSAM enables system integration models to be constructed independently and agnostic to the system allocation to the IMA platform. As opposed to traditional logical/physical model separation, eSAM employs a hybrid modeling method where both logical and physical elements exist in the same model. Hybrid model components are directly connected, similar to traditional federated architectures, even though components are physically connected through the IMA platform. This improves the clarity of the functional system integration, while correctly segregating the roles of system integration and IMA platform allocation. In this way, eSAM addresses a key challenge to modeling IMA system architectures. This paper focuses on the eSAM data and message model, which is core to the method. This includes the re-use of components and related data/message definitions in multi-lane architectures supporting high integrity and high availability solutions. Reuse is managed using template-instance modeling methods where a system part is defined as a template that can be instantiated many times in the system models. eSAM has been implemented using the MathWorks System Composer™ tool, which provides many inherent capabilities including model analysis functionality, which is described in this paper for the purposes of ensuring data interfaces are valid using edit-time checks.","2155-7209","978-1-6654-8607-1","10.1109/DASC55683.2022.9925816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925816","modeling;system architecture;data model;MBSE;model based systems engineering;MBD;model based development;System Composer;Electronic System Architecture Modeling;eSAM","Analytical models;Systems architecture;System integration;Aerospace electronics;Data models;Resource management;Stakeholders","aerospace computing;avionics;program verification;software architecture;systems engineering","hybrid modeling method;logical elements;physical elements;hybrid model components;traditional federated architectures;functional system integration;IMA platform allocation;eSAM addresses;modeling IMA system architectures;eSAM data;message model;multilane architectures;high integrity;template-instance modeling methods;system part;system models;MathWorks System Composer;inherent capabilities including model analysis functionality;data-message modeling;eSAM method;Electronic System Architecture Modeling method;system components;open Integrated Modular Avionics platform;Systems Engineering approach;system integration models;system allocation","","","","5","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This remains true with the adoption of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodologies. Existing SysML-based methodologies often choose between (i) using external requirements documents and/or databases as the authoritative source for requirements truth versus (ii) generating requirements directly, as elements in the system model. In either case, there is often need for the systems engineer to manually develop a model-based requirements representation, as this faculty is not automatic in the commonly-used SysML feature set. Additionally, once the system model has been completed, systems engineers typically must prepare traditional “shall-statement” requirements for external review purposes, as not all stakeholders can be expected to be trained in system model interpretation. This paper details a novel effort to address both problems, by automatically transforming text-based requirements (TBR) into SysML model-based requirement (MBR) representations, and vice versa. The text-to-model based transformation direction uses requirement templates and natural language processing techniques, expanding on work from the field of requirements engineering. This paper also presents an aerospace-domain case study application of the developed tool. In the case study, a selected set of requirements were analyzed, and a system model was constructed. Then, the intermediate output system model was updated with additional elements, to represent the progression of the project's systems engineering process. The modified system model was then analyzed, constructing text-based requirements from the structure. The resulting text-based requirements were compared to the initial set of input requirements to assess consistency in both directions of analysis.

As demand grows for more complex space systems, however, the complexity and capability of CubeSat systems must also increase. One drawback of increased complexity is the increase in obscurity of how a change in one area of the design propagates through the rest of the system. Dealing with this added complexity takes away from student education experiences while also increasing the design cycle time, taking CubeSats further away from the key characteristic advantages that define them. One solution to this is to apply Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methodology to CubeSats, providing a standardized template that the developers can use to make the design cycle more efficient. Lately, the practice of MBSE has become increasingly nuanced and advances have focused on the application of tools and practices to aid in the development of space systems. This includes efforts concerned with the development and description of CubeSats. Most recently, the development of the CubeSat System Reference Model (CSRM) by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) has better enabled the description of CubeSat systems using common modelling language. At the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), the Small Satellite Program has been developing and launching student-built project satellites since 2001 and CubeSats since 2012. Given the time constraints and minimal funding of an undergraduate education program, the need for a simple build template for CubeSats was recognized and the PSAT1U system was conceived. PSAT1U is a 1U CubeSat designed to be utilized as a modular architecture with easily accessible parts allowing students to focus on designing and implementing their on-board payload and mission systems without spending more time carrying out trade studies on well understood subsystems and components. The USNA has used the CSRM along with documentation from the development of PSAT1U to create a Model-Based representation of the PSAT1U system. The aim of this model is to aid in the education of undergraduate engineering students in their capstone design course as well as to reduce design and development times for future CubeSat systems. This paper will present an overview and description of the PSAT1U model, outline the design of the physical system as well as the development of the MBSE model and discuss its implementation in a classroom setting as well its potential role in the development of future systems. Finally, the propagation of system changes through the model will be demonstrated to illustrate the utility of describing a CubeSat system this way.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172748","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172748","","","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;educational courses;systems engineering","PSAT1U;physical system;MBSE model;standardized template;CubeSat-class satellites;complex space systems;student education experiences;design cycle time;Model-Based Systems Engineering methodology;CubeSat System Reference Model;Systems Engineering Space Systems Working Group;common modelling language;student-built project satellites;1U CubeSat;on-board payload;mission systems;Model-Based representation;undergraduate engineering students","","","","5","USGov","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key to the application of model-based development approaches in companies is the introduction of systems engineering architecture frameworks (SEAF) to structure the models of systems to be developed. This paper displays the research to develop a SEAF for SoS. Through workshops and interviews with 18 partners from industry and research, we derived perspectives to be considered for describing and modeling SoS. By analyzing existing SEAFs from literature we concluded, that not all perspectives we identified as relevant are covered by a single framework. Based on our research, especially the explicit consideration of SoS characteristics such as autonomy and interdependence, the integrated consideration of product, production system and validation system development, as well as consideration of different product generations and (re-)use of models appears to be not profoundly addressed. Advancing the state of research, we therefore propose a six-dimensional SoS engineering architecture framework to cover all perspectives we identified as relevant. The proposed framework can further serve as a reference for developers to derive and build specific frameworks tailored to their needs while at the same time supporting consistency, reusability and compatibility of the specific frameworks. The presented framework is an initial proposition which continuously being used and evaluated by its application to structure modeling for a variety of real systems from different industries. Insights from the application are fed back for its further development.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812634","Ministry of Education; Project Management; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812634","ASE;MBSE;Ontology;PGE;Viewpoints","Industries;Production systems;Conferences;Companies;Modeling;Interviews;Complex systems","object-oriented programming;software architecture;systems engineering","model-based systems engineering;complex Systems;model-based development approaches;architecture frameworks;SEAF;product generations;six-dimensional SoS engineering architecture framework;structure modeling;systems engineering architecture framework","","","","30","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current management practices are limited in their structural capacity for coping with such swift transformation, pointing to an urgent need for new approaches in management of complex engineered systems. The model-based approach has emerged as a new promising method to complexity management. However, it is still unclear what role simulation plays in this approach and whether the role differs based on the type of a system under consideration and/or the degree of complexity involved. In this paper, the authors conduct a comparative analysis between the disciplines of System Engineering (SE) and System of Systems Engineering (SoSE), and the significance of simulation in these areas. The paper concludes that simulation represents a major part of modeling of System of Systems (SoS), leading the authors to introduce a new term, Modeling and Simulation Based System of Systems Engineering (M&SBSoSE), to underline the importance of incorporating and integrating simulation into modeling applications in SoSE. It is further also proposed that simulation of SoS should be multi-paradigm to increase the scope of simulation effectiveness in a complex dynamic environment.","","978-1-7281-0457-7","10.1109/SYSOSE.2019.8753868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753868","System of Systems Engineering;Simulation;Modeling;Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Modeling and Simulation Based System of Systems Engineering (M&SBSoSE)","","computer simulation;formal specification;systems engineering","model-based approach;modern engineered systems;complex engineered systems;complexity management;complex dynamic environment;management practices;system engineering;modeling and simulation based system of systems engineering","","1","","37","IEEE","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the low development cost and flight risk of scaled demonstrators, flight tests with demonstrators are an attractive way to assess the reliability and effectiveness of new configurations and/or technologies available for civil aircraft. Nevertheless, engineers still hope to reduce the development cycles and costs of demonstrators to evaluate their multiple civil aircraft design solutions through flight tests in a short period of time. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a formalized requirement and architecture modeling method which is a useful tool in aircraft design. However, no existing MBSE framework has been found suitable for the development of demonstrators due to their unique features. In this paper, an MBSE approach for civil aircraft scaled demonstrator is proposed based on the MagicGrid methodology and the existing technical process for the demonstrator. This approach formalizes the requirement analysis and architecting for demonstrators via system modeling language (SysML). Meanwhile, the stakeholders of civil aircraft scaled demonstrators are identified, and a requirement ontology and modeling standard are established according to existing demonstrator development practice. Then, a case study is performed through a hybrid power demonstrator which carries a hydrogen fuel cell as the main power supply, a set of solar cells, and two lithium cells. The requirement traceability and verifiability are examined, and a logic simulation is executed for architecture, which shows the feasibility of applying the MBSE approach for the development of civil aircraft scaled demonstrators.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3168837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760456","Scaled demonstrator;aircraft design;MBSE;MagicGrid","Aircraft;Stakeholders;Aircraft propulsion;Modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Standards","aerospace computing;aerospace safety;aircraft;autonomous aerial vehicles;design engineering;ontologies (artificial intelligence);systems analysis;systems engineering","scaled demonstrators;flight tests;multiple civil aircraft design solutions;MBSE approach;existing demonstrator development practice;hybrid power demonstrator;civil aircraft scaled demonstrator requirement analysis;architecture modeling method;aircraft design;MagicGrid methodology;requirement analysis;system modeling language;SysML;requirement ontology;modeling standard;hydrogen fuel cell;main power supply;solar cells;lithium cells;requirement traceability;requirement verifiability","","","","23","CCBY","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The pace of change increases the need for effective knowledge management; the trend towards distributed leadership within and external to organizations makes it more difficult. The authors with Dr. Robert Neches (previously with University of Southern California and the Department of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering) envisioned development of a “Nationwide Ecosystem for Complex Engineering.” The “Ecosystem” intended to create a computing environment for virtual collaborative teams to respond to national challenges with engineering solutions in a common knowledge management environment. In development of this concept at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) we realized that a different approach to knowledge management is a core requirement for virtual teams to bring new innovation to challenge problems in complex systems. This approach is not necessarily new, as Dr. Neches has long been a proponent of model-based approaches to knowledge capture (Neches, et al., 1993). However, other work at GTRI combined with these ideas led us to the concept of using formal representations of system architecture as an organizing concept for knowledge. This is significant because ongoing development of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) concepts and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) now provide formalism for general design modeling. We have demonstrated such approaches for large scale engineering design projects. This presentation introduces the concept of a generalized approach to knowledge management centered on models of system architecture.","","978-1-4799-5158-1","10.1109/CTS.2014.6867608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6867608","","Modeling;Computer architecture;Knowledge management;Organizations;Collaboration;Robustness;Technological innovation","knowledge management;software engineering","system architecture;collaborative knowledge capture;knowledge management;virtual tasking;distributed leadership;nationwide ecosystem for complex engineering;computing environment;virtual collaborative teams;Georgia Tech Research Institute;GTRI;model based systems engineering;MBSE;systems modeling language;SysML","","1","","3","IEEE","31 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This suggests the question: what will be the corresponding practice of Model Based Mission Assurance (MBMA)? Contemporaneously, NASA's Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA) is evaluating a new objectives-based approach to standards to ensure that the Safety and Mission Assurance disciplines and programs are addressing the challenges of NASA's changing missions, acquisition and engineering practices, and technology. MBSE is a prominent example of a changing engineering practice. We use NASA's objectives-based strategy for Reliability and Maintainability as a means to examine how MBSE will affect assurance. We surveyed MBSE literature to look specifically for these affects, and find a variety of them discussed (some are anticipated, some are reported from applications to date). Predominantly these apply to the early stages of design, although there are also extrapolations of how MBSE practices will have benefits for testing phases. As the effort to develop MBMA continues, it will need to clearly and unambiguously establish the roles of uncertainty and risk in the system model. This will enable a variety of uncertainty-based analyses to be performed much more rapidly than ever before and has the promise to increase the integration of CRM (Continuous Risk Management) and PRA (Probabilistic Risk Analyses) even more fully into the project development life cycle. Various views and viewpoints will be required for assurance disciplines, and an over-arching viewpoint will then be able to more completely characterize the state of the project/program as well as (possibly) enabling the safety case approach for overall risk awareness and communication.","","978-1-5090-0249-8","10.1109/RAMS.2016.7448047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448047","Assurance;Model Based Systems Engineering","Modeling;Reliability;Testing;Safety;Software;NASA","air safety;probability;reliability;risk analysis","model based mission assurance;NASA assurance future;model based system engineering;MBSE;NASA mission design;NASA mission planning;MBMA;NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance;OSMA;NASA objectives-based strategy;reliability;uncertainty-based analysis;continuous risk management;probabilistic risk analysis;CRM;PRA;project development life cycle","","10","","28","IEEE","7 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RFD process was developed as a procedure used in designing Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and represents an integration of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with formal methods to ensure a “correct-by-construction” design. The extraction of a formal theory is based on Channel Theory as developed by Barwise and Seligman, which is established as a framework for the “flow of information” in terms of category theory. A system consists of components connected via channels. Each component is viewed as an information-flow network and mathematically modeled using a notion of a classification. A classification is a table representation of an information-flow network. Regularities (that represent global behavior of the system) of a classification are captured using a theory (a set of formulas or constraints). One goal of the RFD process is to insure that the requirements are formally consistent. In this paper, we develop a set of algorithms that extracts a theory from a classification, though the theory is not necessarily unique. This work is inclusive of an algorithm which checks whether a regular closure (based on structural rules) of a theory is a theory of a given classification.

Furthermore, the interoperablity and model interchange support between frameworks is a technically hard challenge. The industrial strength standard OMG MOF (Meta-Object Facility) is a solid approach for the definition of domain specific languages. Applying meta-modeling techniques to existing modeling and simulation frameworks reduces obscurity of proprietarity and implicitely language characteristics. On the other hand, standard compliance improves product openness/transparency, reliability and confidence as for primary modes of operation.

Nowadays, ubiquitous connectivity leads to a high degree of communication between systems enabling their cooperation for the provision of new services in a so-called System of Systems (SoS). In contrast to conventional systems engineering new methods and tools are required for service enabling SoS.

The system model is a digital artifact containing descriptions of all the essential objects, their properties, and the relationships between them for the system-of-interest (SoI). The paper describes the context of the system model in relationships to the other components of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) consisting of a modeling language, schema, model-based process, presentation framework, MBSE tools, and knowledgeable workforce. The paper describes how these components interact to provide effective MBSE. Requirements are stated for each component. The paper additionally derives information requirements for the system model according to the systems engineering process's information needs by examining the inputs and outputs of each activity in the systems engineering process. Lastly, the paper derives the quality characteristics for the system model from the literature on ontologies, modeling languages, and semiotics.

This introduces the need for smart monitoring and communication services besides the traditional control-command functions. As a consequence, more complex architectures are required to leverage connected technologies. This challenges traditional processes used to develop such systems. Model-based system engineering (MBSE) has been proposed to tackle this challenge by allowing virtual integration of the system in order to discover flaws earlier in the development process thus reducing rework costs. MBSE requires that several models of the system are conjointly used to assess architectures at different levels of abstraction starting from the overall system level down to specialty domains. However, there is currently a lack of approaches for using these models conjointly to perform virtual integration. In this paper, we present the PST approach allowing seamless integration between systems engineering and real-time specialty domain analyses to support virtual integration.

Such policies are difficult to analyze, and gaps in policy can lead to major deficiencies in the resulting complex systems. This article introduces a framework for policy content modeling (PCM) and analysis. The framework represents the conceptual view and is supported by a step-by-step approach to achieve complete policy modeling and analysis. This approach was used with the intention of identifying and analyzing gaps in policy content and calculating policy toxicity, which negatively affects the resulting system.

However, those techniques cannot handle the complexity in a mechatronic system, because they are still fragmentary. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an approach, which be able to analyze interactions between all system elements and their failures.

This article adapts principles from the software engineering domain DevOps concept (a collaborative merger of system development and operations) into a Systems Engineering DevOps (SEDevOps) life cycle model. This facilitates a merger of systems engineering processes, tools, and products into a surrogate operational environment in which the sustainment of a system is tied closely to the curation of a system model expanded to include the enabling system elements necessary for operations and sustainment (procedures, scripts, etc.). This progression of the systems engineering mindset, focused on digitally transforming and enhancing system operations and sustainment, improves agility in later life cycle phases. A framework for applying SEDevOps is introduced as a new systems modeling language profile. A use-case leveraging this “model-based system operations” framework, shows how merging support elements into a spacecraft system model improves adaptability during operations, exemplifying elements of a DevOps approach to cyber-physical system sustainment.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3015595","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179780","Agile;DevOps;digital transformation;life cycle;model-based systems engineering (MBSE);systems engineering","Modeling;Tools;Unified modeling language;Systems operation;Software engineering;Adaptation models","software engineering;systems engineering","Systems Engineering DevOps lemniscate;full life cycle discipline;cradle-to-grave concept;system life cycles;software engineering domain DevOps concept;system development;Systems Engineering DevOps life cycle model;systems engineering processes;surrogate operational environment;systems engineering mindset;life cycle phases;use-case;spacecraft system model;cyber-physical system sustainment;model-based system operations","","4","","44","IEEE","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A Java plugin was developed in the SysML editor Papyrus for the solicitation, and a SysML metamodel was defined for the simulation architecture. The solicitation associated to the industrial design problem is answered by a multiobjective optimization of the vehicle's cost and electrical consumption using a co-simulation between the tools Simulink and Amesim.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-8396-5","10.1109/SYSCON.2019.8836775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836775","MBSE;SysML;System architect;Solicitation;Simulation architect;Model Identity Card","Modeling;Tools;Autonomous vehicles;Systems architecture;Mathematical model;Companies","design engineering;formal specification;Java;optimisation;road traffic;systems engineering;traffic engineering computing","system architect;autonomous driving application;MBSE;automotive industry;numerical simulation;research institute IRT SystemX;industrial design problem;autonomous vehicle;simulation architecture;SysML editor Papyrus;model based systems engineering;Simulink;Amesim","","4","","26","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yntema","Berwyn, PA 19312; The Aerospace Corp., El Segundo, CA; Bryn Mawr, PA 19010; The MITRE Corporation, McLean, VA; InterCAX, Atlanta, GA","2017 IEEE Aerospace Conference","8 Jun 2017","2017","","","1","15","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is the formalized application of modeling to support key systems engineering tasks for addressing requirements, design, analysis, validation, and verification. The International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) established the MBSE Initiative to promote, advance, and institutionalize the practice of MBSE. As part of this effort, the INCOSE Space Systems Working Group (SSWG) has been investigating the applicability of MBSE for designing CubeSats. Our application of MBSE is enabled by the graphical modeling language Systems Modeling Language (SysML). SysML is used to model all aspects of a system either directly or through interfaces with other models. SysML diagrams are used to describe requirements, structures, behaviors, and parametrics from the system down to the component level. Requirements and design are contained in the model rather than in a series of independent engineering artifacts. The CubeSat Reference Model provides the logical architecture. The logical elements can be reused as a starting point for a mission-specific CubeSat logical architecture, followed by the physical architecture and the CubeSat development. Our prior work established the CubeSat Reference Model domain as consisting of the stakeholders, CubeSat enterprise, external environment, and external constraints, with the CubeSat enterprise consisting of space and ground segments. The CubeSat enterprise architecture has been refined to accommodate an external service providing CubeSat transportation to a launch site, integration into a launch vehicle, launch, and deployment. It has also been refined to accommodate a CubeSat project developing its own ground station or operating with an existing ground station that provides uplink and downlink services. Space and ground subsystems had been identified in our prior work. Use cases have now been established to further define the subsystem capabilities. It has been recognized that there are two modeling efforts. One is the SSWG developing a CubeSat Reference Model with its logical architecture. The other is a team eventually taking the CubeSat Reference Model as a basis for its mission-specific logical and physical architectures. Therefore, there are two categories of stakeholders. A stakeholder is any entity that has an interest in the system. The stakeholders for the CubeSat Reference Model include INCOSE, the Object Management Group (OMG), regulatory agencies, and the university teams that will be using the CubeSat Reference Model. We are exploring having NASA, NOAA, and FCC regulations contained within their own SysML models and connecting those models to our CubeSat Reference Model. The stakeholders for the mission-specific CubeSat model are those with an interest in the mission-specific CubeSat space and ground system. Typical stakeholders for a space and ground system include sponsor, user, operator, project manager, project engineer, developer, and tester. The list of stakeholders for a university CubeSat project is much smaller. We are collaborating with OMGs Space Domain Task Force (SDTF) to adopt the CubeSat Reference Model as an OMG specification.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943691","","Space stations","aerospace computing;artificial satellites;SysML;systems engineering","FCC regulations;NOAA;NASA;OMGs Space Domain Task Force;SDTF;regulatory agencies;OMG;object management group;physical architectures;space subsystems;ground subsystems;uplink services;downlink services;ground station;launch vehicle;space segments;ground segments;mission-specific CubeSat logical architecture;logical elements;component level;independent engineering artifacts;SysML diagrams;Systems Modeling Language;graphical modeling language;International Council on Systems Engineering;INCOSE Space Systems Working Group;SSWG;MBSE;CubeSat model-based system engineering reference model","","7","","9","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the implementation of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) a more qualitative set of EECs, based on expected levels of Descriptive System Model (DSM) maturity, can be used to evaluate readiness for SETR completion. A paradigm shift of this magnitude requires stakeholder buy-in and input to determine evaluation factors for DSM maturity. The ability to dynamically assess model maturity requires well defined. relation-mapping and methodology. Given the above conditions are met, a metric suite can be established, within a profile, to assess a model's maturity and quality. The metric suite can be applied to any model using the same mapping and methodology. The metric suite probes the model and returns a maturity percentage that can be compared to predetermined, tailorable values. This assessment can then be used to determine readiness for a given SETR milestone.This paper captures a proof of concept experiment for implementing metrics as a portion of Entrance Criteria for a Critical Design Review. A subset of metrics was developed to build stakeholder buy-in, indicating the development of a system has matured sufficiently to be reviewed for a SETR milestone decision. The initial demonstration was well received and there are continuing efforts to improve the ability to assess a model's maturity for SETR milestones. The experiment identified that the metrics are unable to assess against gap information. In contrast, the benefits gained from using a dynamic set of entrance criteria include enabling a more event-based SETR, improved confidence in the model's validity, and can be used to provide more data to assist with effort resource planning.","2687-8828","978-1-7281-1783-6","10.1109/ISSE46696.2019.8984435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8984435","metrics;SETR;MBSE;Systems Engineering;Technical Review;Model Based;Entrance Exit Criteria","","software metrics;software reviews;systems engineering","Model maturity metrics;Systems Engineering Technical Reviews;Objective Qualifying Evidence;Model-Based Systems Engineering;Descriptive System Model maturity;SETR completion;DSM maturity;entrance criteria;Critical Design Review;SETR milestone decision;exit criteria","","2","","4","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) is a systematic evidence-based process that assesses technology maturity based on Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). System Readiness Assessment (SRA) is the process of conducting integrated assessments of a developing system to assess technology maturation and provide a systemic understanding of the development life-cycle. The Integration Readiness Levels (IRL) scale complements TRL in representing integration between technological elements in a system, and both scales are used in SRA to calculate system readiness metrics. SRA is expected to be an emerging systems engineering best practice and has evolved over the last decade. However, SRA does not explicitly guide whether simulation could comply with IRL dedicated to interface verification and validation. Modeling and simulation (M&S) play many roles in systems engineering. Digital and M&S technologies advancement, as Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) and digital twins, may contribute to reducing space missionś costs and schedule, along with trends in systems and technology reuse. This research identified the possible roles of modeling and simulation in assessing spacecraft Integration Readiness Levels. Results showed M&S possible roles for each IRL and whether the roles were essential or support to achieve IRL. Also, a link between system life cycle processes and these results contributes to the SRA research stream. A case study with the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) program was used to validate part of the proposed theory, in line with other cases extracted from the literature. This paper contributes to the SRA research stream with these theoretical and practical results, by suggesting future studies that could improve SRA practice and consequently support the decision-making on technology introduction in CoPS.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447057","Modeling and simulation;Space system;System readiness assessment;Integration readiness levels;Model-based systems engineering;Digital twin","Space vehicles;Systematics;Terminology;Digital twin;Space missions;Simulation;Decision making","decision making;modelling;simulation;space vehicles;systems engineering","system integration process;technology readiness assessment;technology maturity assessment;system readiness assessment;systems engineering;spacecraft integration readiness levels;integration readiness levels;development life cycle;technology readiness levels;systematic evidence based process;modeling and simulation;model based system engineering;decision making","","","","30","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their development is governed by aviation authority and industry recognized standards, guidelines and recommended practices. Comprehensive methods for Model-Based Systems Engineering exist which address these guidance materials but their setup and their application can be quite resource-demanding. Especially the new and rather small key players - start-ups and development teams in an educational environment - can be overwhelmed to setup such development processes. For these clients, the authors propose a custom workflow for the development of system architectures. It shall ensure development rigor, quality and consistency. The authors show how the custom workflow has been established based on the ARP4754A and its level of compliance to the standard’s process objectives.

Using simulation to perform design validation with system-level models earlier in the life cycle stands to bridge the gap between design of the system (based on system-level requirements) and verifying those requirements/validating the system as a whole. This case study stands as an example of how a project can validate a system-level design earlier in the project life cycle than traditional V&V processes by using simulation on a system model.

Consequently, to foster the adoption of MBSE, practitioners need to understand what factors are impeding or promoting success in applying such a method in their existing processes and infrastructure. While many of the existing studies on the adoption of MBSE in specific contexts focus on its applicability, it is unclear what attributes foster a successful adoption of MBSE and what targets the companies are setting. Consequently, practitioners need to understand what adoption strategies are applicable. To shed more light on this topic, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 professionals working in the vehicular domain with roles in several MBSE adoption projects. The aim is to investigate their experiences, reasons, targets, and promoting and impeding factors. The obtained data was synthesized using thematic analysis. This study suggests that the reasons for MBSE adoption relate to two main themes: better management of complex engineering tasks and communication between different actors. Furthermore, engagement, activeness and access to expert knowledge are indicated as factors promoting MBSE adoption success, while the lack of MBSE knowledge is an impeding factor for successful adoption.","","978-83-962423-9-6","10.15439/2022F47","Delta; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909433","","Computer science;Analytical models;Quality assurance;Computational modeling;Companies;Complexity theory;Interviews","object-oriented methods;organisational aspects;systems engineering","vehicular systems;model-based systems engineering;MBSE adoption projects;thematic analysis","","1","","17","","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following a modular approach and for each subsystem, we search for a so-called sub-barrier candidate represented as a linear combination of a priori user-defined basis functions. We formulate the conditions on sub-barrier candidates as robust convex programs (RCPs) which are semi-infinite linear programs. Collecting sampled data from each subsystem, we approximate each RCP via a scenario convex program (SCP) which is a finite linear program. We provide an explicit formula to compute the minimum number of sampled data guaranteeing a desired mismatch between the optimal value of each RCP and that of the corresponding SCP in a probabilistic sense. To ensure that the sum of the sub-barrier candidates is a barrier function for the whole network, we define a global dissipativity condition on top of the local SCPs. The local SCPs are thus related to each other via this global condition. This results in a large-scale optimization problem in a standard canonical form which is efficiently solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated by applying it to a room temperature control problem in a 100-room building.","2475-1456","","10.1109/LCSYS.2021.3135455","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(grant numbers:WI 1458/16-1); H2020 European Resuscitation Council (ERC) Starting Grant AutoCPS(grant numbers:804639); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9650523","Data-driven methods;formal safety verification;interconnected systems;barrier functions","Safety;Probabilistic logic;Trajectory;Distributed databases;Computational complexity;Optimization;Knowledge engineering","computational complexity;convex programming;linear programming;network theory (graphs);probability","data-driven safety verification;discrete time networks;compositional data-driven approach;formal guarantees;modular approach;sub-barrier candidate;a priori user-defined basis functions;robust convex programs;semiinfinite linear programs;finite linear program;alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm;computational complexity","","1","","20","IEEE","14 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is accompanied by the trend towards software-intensive avionics systems due to the requirement for complex and computationally expensive algorithms. Considering the successful application of agile developments in the software domain, one might conclude that the agile paradigm would be the perfect fit to address these issues. However, for highly safety-critical domains such as aviation, multiple conflicts with the agile paradigm exist. Especially the constraint to follow rigorous and well documented processes contradicts the ideas of agile. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive and well documented, but still flexible process is necessary. Accordingly, this paper proposes a first step towards such an agile safety-guided design, by combining Model-Based Systems Engineering with the System-Theoretic Process Analysis. Particularly, focus is placed on enabling an iterative safety-guided design by providing functionality to track design changes to the corresponding safety artifacts. This automated functionality is enabled by a formalized execution of the safety analysis. At first glance, formalization sounds like a contradiction to the agile paradigm. However, we argue that formality and agility are not necessarily contradicting each other. Our theory is that moving the focus of formality from the human activities to the assisting functionality even increases overall agility. The iterative safety-guided design and resulting identification of safety improvements is demonstrated with examples of a flight assistance system.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-8182-3","10.1109/ISSE54508.2022.10005396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005396","Safety;Agile;Formality;MBSE;STPA;SysML;Design Changes;Tracing;UAM;CPS","Bridges;Analytical models;Automation;Software algorithms;Aerospace electronics;Market research;Software","aerospace computing;aerospace safety;avionics;program testing;safety-critical software;software reliability;systems engineering","agile developments;agile paradigm;agile safety-guided design;complex algorithms;computationally expensive algorithms;design changes;efficient development processes;flexible development processes;flexible process;formality;formalization sounds;formalized execution;highly safety-critical domains;iterative safety-guided design;market entry;model-based STPA;model-based systems engineering;resulting identification;safety analysis;safety artifacts;safety improvements;software domain;software-intensive avionics systems;system-theoretic process analysis;urban air mobility","","1","","26","IEEE","10 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the interplay of those Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) itself forms a System of Systems (SoS), engineering such a system becomes a difficult task. This is mainly attributed to the evolutionary development of its independently operating components, which results in some kind of unpredictable and often undesirable behavior. Considering this from a developer’s perspective, it is important to investigate the system’s behaviors before its actual implementation. However, as methods applied in Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) have proven to be a major technology driver when it comes to developing the architecture of these industrial systems, their simulation is still not standardized. Thus, this paper introduces an Industry 4.0 specific tool-chain enabling the co-simulation of components within any developed industrial system architecture. This allows the investigation of varying industrial CPS and their interplay during run-time with the goal to detect undesired emergent behaviors. By doing so, the model is developed regarding the specifications of the Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), while Mosaik is the tool of choice for creating the Co-Simulation environment. In order to validate the developed tool-chain, a case study utilizing modular production units within an industrial automation system is applied.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-3168-2","10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582531","System Architecture;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0);Industrial Systems Engineering;Co-Simulation","Industries;Systems architecture;Production;Tools;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Task analysis","cyber-physical systems;factory automation;intelligent manufacturing systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;systems engineering","industrial automation system;modular production units;intelligent manufacturing components;cyber-physical systems;evolutionary development;model based systems engineering;industrial system architecture;industrial CPS;Reference Architecture Industrie 4.0;RAMI 4.0;model-based co-simulation;Industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;system of systems;SoS;MBSE;Industry 4.0;manufacturing systems;Mosaik","","","","29","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With many of these vehicles providing the human operator knowledge of their location through line-of-sight observation, often without integrated collision avoidance technology, sUAS are presenting an increasing concern for the safety and security of individuals on the ground below, as well as all air vehicles in low altitude airspace. Government, industry partners, and academia have collaborated for the past decade to develop an understanding and potential solutions to the communication deficiencies between sUAS operators, air traffic controllers, and air vehicles. These activities have paved the way for dramatic innovation to overcome the deficiencies in situation awareness of sUAS operators and air traffic controllers with regard to proximity operations of sUAS with each other, ground-based obstacles and potentially manned aircraft. This research has proposed system architectures based upon the needs of government and commercial entities. Simultaneously, the hobbyist community has also recognized this problem and began developing competitive technologies consistent with their perceived needs. These solutions vary along multiple dimensions, including safety, security, and cost.

Evidence across the Services and industry has affirmed digital engineering is a critical practice necessary to support acquisition in an environment of increasing global challenges, dynamic threats, rapidly evolving technologies, and increasing life expectancy of our systems currently in operation. Digital engineering updates the systems engineering practices to take full advantage of computational technology, modeling, data analytics, and data sciences. The Department of Defense's vision for digital engineering is to modernize how the Department designs, develops, delivers, operates, and sustains systems, while continuing to practice systems engineering efficiently and effectively. Digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way acquisition and engineering are performed across a wide range of government agencies, industries, and academia. As the Department of Defense (DoD) transitions to digital engineering, there is a need to develop and maintain an acquisition workforce and culture that is literate in model-based engineering, competent in digital engineering models, methods, processes, tools, and understands digital artifacts across the acquisition lifecycle. One of the critical steps that was identified to enable this digital transformation is the development of a competency model that can be used to modernize the workforce. This paper outlines the results after completion of Phase 1 of WRT-1006, which concluded in the initial release of the Digital Engineering Competency Framework (DECF) by SERC, and the initial Phase 2 efforts of implementing the framework as a benchmark for the content of a digital engineering training curriculum. The purpose of the DECF is to provide clear guidance for the DoD acquisition workforce, in particular the engineering acquisition workforce, through clearly defined competencies that illuminate the knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors required for digital engineering professionals. The approach taken to develop the DECF drew from existing competency models in fields neighboring digital engineering and from the feedback of experienced practicing digital engineering community. The initial version of the DECF v.1.0 was released as a key WRT1006 Phase 1 result with confidence in the maturity of the structure and general content. The overarching structure of the DECF v.1.0 consists of competency areas, proficiency levels within the competency, and constituting knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviors (KSABs). Now that this benchmark is established, the second phase of our project involves the comparison of the DECF to the existing Defense Acquisition University (DAU) curriculum to determine what elements of such existing curriculum already support the competencies in the model. This is a bidirectional analysis that will both identify gaps in the training curriculum and potentially identify curriculum content that should be incorporated into the competency model. Although this project is specifically applying the DECF to the acquisition process, the model has applications in any area that will implement Digital Engineering initiatives. Furthermore, this framework has additional use cases that will be explored further including hiring for Digital Engineering positions and ensuring the current work force has the necessary skillsets to adequately implement a digital transformation.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447063","U.S. Department of Defense; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447063","Digital Engineering;digital transformation;competency model;framework;Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);acquisition and engineering workforce","Training;Industries;Knowledge engineering;Analytical models;Digital transformation;Benchmark testing;Tools","computer based training;educational courses;engineering education;software engineering;systems engineering","DECF;competency model;digital transformation;Systems Engineering Research Center;model-based engineering;digital engineering models;digital engineering training curriculum;digital engineering competency framework;engineering acquisition workforce;WRT-1006","","2","","6","IEEE","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, system testing with simulation should be provided as a simple facility for the performance evaluation of complex systems. Transportation systems are complex and their behavior is determined by dynamic factors. However, research efforts define simulation models for transportation systems, using custom or simulation-specific notation. Additionally, model-based approaches for transportation systems emphasize peripheral issues, such as safety conditions and environmental impact. In this work, a framework that enables seamless performance evaluation of Railway Transportation System (RTS) models via simulation is proposed.

Literacy of systems engineers in reading, sharing and elaborating models has therefore become an issue. Whatever the modeling language, elaboration of models is a highly complex intellectual process and SysML is no exception. Feedback from industry practitioners and MBSE lecturers suggests that developers of SysML models often stumble on the same problem: thinking about the system before modeling it in SysML. The authors of this paper propose to ease that elaboration process by using mind maps. With their graphic form and rather flexible way of organizing ideas, mind maps turn out to be a good candidate to help thinking about the system. Unlike approaches that directly switch from mind maps to SysML diagrams dedicated to one specific system, this paper introduces an intermediate step: mind maps first enable elaboration of diagrams patterns. The latter may in turn be instantiated on one or several systems. Without loss of generality, the proposed approach is step-wise illustrated on real-time systems monitored by software controllers. Patterns are proposed to cover need expression, requirement capture, use case driven analysis and design.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-3992-3","10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773934","Mind Maps;SysML v2;Real-Time Systems","Industries;Graphics;Conferences;Education;Switches;Software;Real-time systems","formal specification;real-time systems;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","systems engineers;modeling language;highly complex intellectual process;MBSE lecturers;SysML models;elaboration process;SysML diagrams;real-time systems;mind maps upstream SysML;Model Based Systems Engineering;document-centric approaches","","2","","17","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two fields in particular have attempted to traverse this convergence challenge: systems engineering and network science. Systems engineering has developed as a practical and interdisciplinary engineering discipline that enables the successful realization of complex systems from concept, through design, to full implementation based upon graphical modeling languages. In contrast, network science has developed to quantitatively analyze networks that appear in a wide variety of engineering systems but suffers from disparate terminology and a lack of consensus. This paper provides a tensor-based formulation of several of the most important parts of hetero-functional graph theory. More specifically, it discusses the system concept, the hetero-functional adjacency matrix, and introduces the hetero-functional incidence tensor for the first time. The tensor-based formulation described in this work makes a stronger tie between HFGT and its ontological foundations in MBSE. Finally, the tensor-based formulation facilitates an understanding of the relationships between HFGT and multilayer networks “despite its disparate terminology and lack of consensus In so doing, this tensor-based treatment is likely to advance Kivela et. al’s goal to discern the similarities and differences between these mathematical models in as precise a manner as possible.","","978-1-6654-9623-0","10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812692","Hetero-Functional Graph Theory;Model Based Systems Engineering;sustainable energy transition;American Multi-modal Energy System;Sustainability","Visualization;Tensors;Terminology;Smart cities;Transportation;Mathematical models;Graph theory","graph theory;large-scale systems;matrix algebra;STEM;systems engineering;tensors","hetero-functional incidence tensor;STEM fields;NAE game-changing goals;engineering system;meta-problem-solving skill set;systems engineering;network science;interdisciplinary engineering discipline;complex systems;engineering systems;tensor-based formulation;hetero-functional graph theory;hetero-functional adjacency matrix;multilayer networks;tensor-based treatment;graphical modeling languages;HFGT;ontological foundations;MBSE;mathematical models","","","","16","IEEE","6 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This contribution compares existing understandings of L and P architecture views and derives a detailed definition. As L and P are consecutive architecture views and strongly dependent on each other, the transition and specification process of those is elaborated as well.

This research investigates improvements to this process by integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) techniques; enforcing rigorous, quantitative evaluation metrics with a corresponding understanding of uncertainties; and eliciting stakeholder feedback in order to generate an architecture that is better optimized and trusted to provide improved value for the stakeholders. The proposed methodology presents a decision authority with an integrated assessment of architecture alternatives, to include expected performance evaluated against desired parameters with corresponding uncertainty distributions, and traceable to the concerns of the system's stakeholders. This thus enables a more informed and objective selection of the preferred alternative. We present a case study that analyzes the evaluation of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) providing satellite command and control with cyber security protections. This serves to define and demonstrate a new, more transparent and trusted architecture selection process, and the results show that it consistently achieves the desired improvements.

Digital representation of those components through the definition of the corresponding description models starts in the early design phase of the engineering process. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach promotes increased reusability of component models and allows an automatic generation of the system of interest model and its validation through simulation, which results in a shorter design phase. However, existing solutions for CPS description models contain mainly skills and functionalities of the component from a task-oriented perspective to achieve platform-independent code generation for the components control. Semantic information in the skills description usually is completely absent or present only to the extent, which is not enough to match the corresponding components to the product requirements and necessary production processes. Instead, production cell components are manually assigned to the manufacturing processes, which are required for the product. This manual step hinders the automatic production cell model generation based on the product requirements. To allow automatic matching from product descriptions to specific CPSs, a new approach to CPS description is necessary. This description should allow the entirely automatic generation of production cell models through the matching of CPS skills and product requirements. In this paper, a semantic metamodel for CPS is presented. This metamodel enriches CPS models with high-granularity graph-based skill descriptions, which, in combination with the appropriate manufacturing process descriptions, allow automatic matching for production planning and further simulation and ontimization.","","978-1-7281-0883-4","10.1109/CONCAPANXXXIX47272.2019.8976997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976997","CPS;MBSE;Metamodel","","cellular manufacturing;cyber-physical systems;embedded systems;manufacturing processes;product design;production engineering computing;production planning;program compilers;systems engineering","metamodel;process-oriented cyber-physical system description;modern production cells;cyber-physical systems;production cell components;digital representation;corresponding description models;early design phase;engineering process;model-based systems engineering approach;interest model;shorter design phase;CPS description models;task-oriented perspective;platform-independent code generation;components control;skills description;corresponding components;product requirements;necessary production processes;manufacturing processes;automatic production cell model generation;automatic matching;product descriptions;entirely automatic generation;production cell models;CPS skills;CPS models;high-granularity graph-based skill descriptions;appropriate manufacturing process descriptions;production planning","","5","","26","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Notably, smaller enterprises are facing a tremendous amount of effort required for the modelling and operation of Digital Twins. While less feature-rich informational Digital Twins may be viable, autonomous Digital Twins using methods of Machine Learning (ML) are unattainable for these companies due to the high complexity. With Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), an approach was introduced to grasp this complexity using system models e.g., SysML-diagrams. The main purpose of these diagrams is an improvement of stakeholder communication.

To solve the problem, a semantic approach combining a unified modeling method GOPPRRE modeling method with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is proposed to realize property verification. The syntax of the multi-architecture modeling language KARMA based on the GOPPRRE modeling method is extended to realize property verification based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories, which enables the KARMA language to verify the models by evaluating the constraints which are defined based on the model properties. The proposed approach supports the evaluation of property constraints defined by different modeling languages for trade-off optimization in a unified language. The approach is evaluated by a case of optimizing the matching between workers and processes in a multi-architecture modeling tool MetaGraph which is developed based on KARMA.

In this context, the understanding of the underlying concepts and relationships em-bedded in the system artifacts becomes a cornerstone to properly exploit engineering artifacts. MBSE tool-chains and suites, such as Matlab Simulink, can be applied to different engineering activities: architecture design (descriptive modeling), simulation (analytical modeling) or verification. Reuse capabilities in specific engineering tools are a kind of non-functional aspect that is usually covered providing a type of search capability based on artifact metadata. In this work, we aim to ease the reuse of the knowledge embedded in Simulink models through a solution called PhysicalModel2Simulink. The proposed approach makes use of an ontology for representing, indexing and retrieving information following a meta-model (mainly to semantically represent concepts and relationships). Under this schema, both meta-data and contents are represented using a common domain vocabulary and taxonomy creating a property graph that can be exploited for system artifact discovery. To do so, a mapping between the Matlab Simulink meta-model and the RSHP (RelationShHiP) meta-model is defined to represent and serialize physical models in a repository. Then, a retrieval process is implemented on top of this repository to allow users to perform text-based queries and look up similar artifacts. To validate the proposed solution, 38 Simulink models have been used and 20 real user queries have been designed to study the effectiveness, in terms or precision and recall, of the proposed solution against the Matlab Simulink searching capabilities.","2374-9709","978-1-6654-0601-7","10.1109/NOMS54207.2022.9789840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789840","information representation;physical system models;model reuse;knowledge reuse;simulink","Analytical models;Vocabulary;Software packages;Taxonomy;Ontologies;Metadata;Mathematical models","embedded systems;meta data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;query processing;software engineering;systems engineering","38 Simulink models;physical models;development life-cycle;collaborative Model-based Systems Engineering environment;computer systems;communicating tools;reusing previous engineering designs;system artifacts;engineering artifacts;MBSE tool-chains;different engineering activities;architecture design;descriptive modeling;analytical modeling;reuse capabilities;specific engineering tools;artifact metadata;PhysicalModel2Simulink;system artifact discovery;Matlab Simulink meta-model;RSHP meta-model","","","","33","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evolution of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) lies in a middle ground between legacy document-based SoSE and formal methods. SysML is a graphical language but not a formal language. Initiatives in the Object Management Group (OMG), such as the development of the Foundational Unified Modeling Language (fUML) seek to bring precise semantics to object-oriented modeling languages. Following the philosophy of fUML, we offer a framework for associating precise semantics with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and SysML models essential for SoSE architecting and design. Straightforward methods are prescribed to develop the essential models and to create semantic transformations between them. Matrix representations can be used to perform analyses that are concordant with the system of UML or SysML models that represent the system or SoS.

We define fuzzy classifications (models for distributed systems), extract component and system theories (sets of logical expressions), and ensure consistency of requirements for the Responsive and Formal Design (RFD) Process. The RFD process is a SE methodology that relates a set of requirements, associated models, simulations, and the relationship between them, by integrating Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to manage system modeling complexity with formal methods to ensure that designs are verifiably correct against their requirements. To translate informal requirements to logical expressions in the RFD process, we first model requirements using a 3-tuple structure called a classification formulated from Barwise and Seligman's channel theory. A classification consists of ""tokens"" (observed situations) and ""types"" (situation features) and a binary relation classifying tokens with types. However, classifying tokens using types as present (represented as `1') or absent (represented as `0') as used in channel theory is not always possible (since it involves vagueness and imprecission) and the representation lacks expressiveness to reason about relations among such types (vague situation features). Hence, a binary classification doesn't capture uncertainity. In this paper, we consider a degree of truth in the relation between tokens and types to define a fuzzy classification.

The Systems Modeling Language (SysML), like any language intended for a large audience, is in tension between the desires for simplicity and for expressiveness. In order to be more expressive, many specialized language elements may be introduced, which will unfortunately make a complete understanding of the language a more daunting task. While this may be acceptable for systems modelers, it will increase the challenge of including subsystem engineers in the modeling effort. One possible answer to this situation is the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), which are fully supported by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). SysML is in fact a DSL for systems engineering. The expressive power of a DSL can be enhanced through the use of diagram customization. Various domains have already developed their own schematic vocabularies. Within the space engineering community, two excellent examples are the propulsion and telecommunication subsystems. A return to simple box-and-line diagrams (e.g., the SysML Internal Block Diagram) are in many ways a step backward. In order allow subsystem engineers to contribute directly to the model, it is necessary to make a system modeling tool at least approximate in accessibility to drawing tools like Microsoft PowerPoint and Visio. The challenge is made more extreme in a concurrent engineering environment, where designs must often be drafted in an hour or two. In the case of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Team X concurrent design team, a subsystem is specified using a combination of PowerPoint for drawing and Excel for calculation. A pilot has been undertaken in order to meld the drawing portion and the production of master equipment lists (MELs) via a SysML authoring tool, MagicDraw. Team X currently interacts with its customers in a process of sharing presentations. There are several inefficiencies that arise from this situation. The first is that a customer team must wait two weeks to a month (which is 2-4 times the duration of most Team X studies themselves) for a finalized, detailed design description. Another is that this information must be re-entered by hand into the set of engineering artifacts and design tools that the mission concept team uses after a study is complete. Further, there is no persistent connection to Team X or institutionally shared formulation design tools and data after a given study, again reducing the direct reuse of designs created in a Team X study. This paper presents the underpinnings of subsystem DSLs as they were developed for this pilot. This includes specialized semantics for different domains as well as the process by which major categories of objects were derived in support of defining the DSLs. The feedback given to us by the domain experts on usability, along with a pilot study with the partial inclusion of these tools is also discussed.","1095-323X","978-1-4673-1813-6","10.1109/AERO.2013.6497134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497134","","Concurrent engineering;Laboratories;Servers;Shape;Tin;Libraries;Propulsion","aerospace propulsion;concurrent engineering;programming language semantics;systems engineering;Unified Modeling Language","concurrent engineering environment;domain-specific languages;diagram customization;model-based systems engineering;MBSE;subsystem engineers;systems modeling language;SysML;specialized language elements;DSL;unified modeling language;UML;space engineering community;propulsion;telecommunication subsystems;box-and-line diagrams;internal block diagram;Microsoft PowerPoint;Visio;Jet Propulsion Laboratory;Team X concurrent design team;Excel;master equipment lists;MEL;MagicDraw;engineering artifacts;specialized semantics","","3","","15","IEEE","13 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes industrial research activities, which practically investigate the opportunities of using common MBSE approaches and applying necessary extensions for an automatic generation of shop floor MES gateway configurations. As a basis, systems engineering models for production systems, i.e., an extension to Systems Modeling Language, and standard model transformation mechanisms, i.e., MOF-Model-to- Text Transformation Language, are used.

These databases often run in heterogeneous hardware and software environments and use different, project-specific data models. These conditions lead to a high degree of autonomy but to an increasing heterogeneity. The heterogeneity then leads to the problem that these databases cannot be easily merged into a federated database system (FDBS). In general, a FDBS integrates multiple autonomous database systems into a single FDBS. The challenge is now to merge multiple heterogeneous systems into one FDBS to provide successful federated searches. Here, the term successful means that the results of a search query are correctly and completely answered by all integrated domain-specific database systems. In addition to delivering correct and complete results from these queries, semantically and syntactically correct mappings of various database schemes must be ensured. We argue that at the faculty of the Humanities, a cross-domain use of autonomously developed databases offers added value in terms of data analysis and evaluation. Hence, the challenge that exists is to develop a suitable federated database infrastructure that supports the development of autonomous information systems, while heterogeneity does not increase. To meet this challenge, in IT projects in the defense sector and in the public administration of the federal government, the V-model is a mandatory procedural standard to develop IT systems systematically. When developing a cross-domain information system, special attention should be paid to the development of variants, i.e. the project-specific information systems, so that the extension of the federated infrastructure at the faculty is guaranteed and can be maintained in the long term. In the area of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) variant modeling is a very current topic and no standard exists. However, there are some approaches that can be used, such as the method Variant Modeling with SysML (VAMOS). VAMOS is characterized by its ease of use to model variants and can be combined very well with other methods. In this paper we present a model-based approach to develop a federated database infrastructure for supporting the usability of a cross-domain information system. For the development of a federated database infrastructure we present how the V-model can be combined with the VAMOS method using the tool Cameo Systems Modeler for modeling and simulating in general, the broker-based SysML Toolbox for simulating database interactions, and the database management system Heurist for creating a cross-domain information system.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-3992-3","10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773811","SysML;modeling;federated search;schema mapping;cross-domain information system;V-model;VAMOS","Humanities;Government;Database systems;Systems Modeling Language;Software;Hardware;Metasearch","data analysis;data models;database management systems;distributed databases;information systems;query processing;systems engineering","project-specific information systems;federated infrastructure;Model-based Systems Engineering variant modeling;method Variant Modeling;model-based approach;cross-domain information system;V-model;Systems Modeler;database interactions;database management system Heurist;Model-based development;cross-domain information Systems;autonomously developed databases;heterogeneous hardware;software environments;different project-specific data models;federated database system;FDBS;multiple autonomous database systems;multiple heterogeneous systems;successful federated searches;integrated domain-specific database systems;database schemes;suitable federated database infrastructure;autonomous information systems","","3","","24","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, they may be studied as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Since their purpose is to provide transportation services that have a critical role in urban societies and affect millions of users, they have to be precisely evaluated, focusing on their adequacy to deliver the expected service quality. In the case of RTSs, service quality is expressed by Level of Service (LoS) indicators related to the passenger's experience within RTS components, such as stations and trains. Such indicators express, for example, space and time restrictions, and are standardized in international bodies. In this paper, an approach, integrating LoS concepts in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), is proposed, enabling the description and verification of LoS requirements for RTS SysML models. Exploiting SysML, a RTS model can be generated, populated with basic transportation entities and specific LoS requirements associated to them. Requirements are described in a simple, abstract fashion by the RTS engineer, while more specific requirements are automatically generated and associated with basic RTS components. Furthermore, verification of RTS LoS is facilitated, helping the system designer to assess alternative RTS operation scenarios. In this context, a case study discussing the Athens Metro System is briefly examined.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-3664-0","10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369577","Transportation Systems;Model-based Engineering;SysML;Quality/Level of Service;Requirements","Quality of service;Modeling;Systems Modeling Language;Unified modeling language;Tools;Rail transportation","railway engineering;SysML;transportation","Systems Modeling Language;transportation services;expected service quality;Service indicators;LoS concepts;RTS SysML models;basic transportation entities;specific LoS requirements;RTS engineer;basic RTS components;RTS LoS;system designer;Athens Metro System;railway transportation systems;Systems-of-Systems;Model-Based Systems Engineering;MBSE;SoS","","1","","28","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the problem exhibits deep uncertainty. Deep uncertainty refers to the condition where the full range of outcomes of a decision is not knowable. A key strategy to mitigate deep uncertainty is to update decisions when new information is learned. In this paper, the spacecraft development problem is modeled as a dynamic, chance-constrained, stochastic optimization problem. The Model-based Adaptive Design under Uncertainty (MADU) framework is presented, in which conflict-directed search is combined with reuse of information to solve the development problem efficiently in the presence of deep uncertainty. The framework is built within a Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) paradigm in which a SysML model contains the design, the design space, and information learned during search. The development problem is composed of a series of optimizations, each different than the previous. Changes between optimizations can be the addition or removal of a design variable, expansion or contraction of the domain of a design variable, addition or removal of constraints, or changes to the objective function. These changes are processed to determine which search decisions can be preserved from the previous optimization. The framework is illustrated on a case study drawn from the thermal design of the REgolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) instrument. This case study demonstrates the advantages of the MADU framework with the solution found 30% faster than an algorithm that doesn't reuse information. With this framework, designers can more efficiently explore the design space and perform updates to a design when new information is learned. Future work includes extending the framework to multiple objective functions and continuous design variables.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172672","","Space vehicles;Adaptation models;Uncertainty;Adaptive systems;Stochastic processes;Linear programming;Search problems","aerospace control;constraint theory;optimisation;space vehicles;stochastic processes;systems engineering","SysML model;MADU framework;regolith X-ray imaging spectrometer instrument;space system development;continuous design variables;thermal design;design space;model-based systems engineering paradigm;uncertainty framework;model-based adaptive design;stochastic optimization problem;spacecraft development problem;deep uncertainty","","","","54","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, MBSE tools and techniques also have many beneficial applications in the definition of requirements for conceptual modelling, and in the design for modelling, simulation, analysis, and implementation of aerospace systems. An MBSE based methodology, known as the Whole-of-System Analytical Framework (WSAF) [1], was developed to provide structure, rigour and traceability to the definition of modelling and simulation requirements for the analysis of weapon and combat system performance. The WSAF is grounded in standard analysis principles and practises but applies MBSE tools and techniques to support the analyst throughout the process [2]. Employing the WSAF, the study definition for the analysis of a weapon system's performance is achieved by deconstructing the systems of interest into their functional components. This activity considers the weapon “kill chain” from initial target detection through to assessing the effect of the weapon [3], and can include the entire combat system (including third party support platforms). Each system's functionality is then systematically analysed in order to identify the questions that must be addressed by a study. The modelling, simulation and analysis requirements necessary to answer those questions are then derived [1] [2]. By functionally defining the whole weapon system kill chain, analysts are able to ensure that their analysis is complete and rigorous, while the MBSE tools provide the required traceability [2]. The WSAF has been applied across the Australian defence domain and is utilised by one of DST Group's partner organisations, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC). This paper describes the WSAF methodology using case studies from DST Group and DRDC. Lessons accumulated by both organisations are discussed, covering the application of MBSE tools and techniques to support weapon and combat system modelling, simulation and analysis for over a decade.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396501","","Analytical models;Tools;Atmospheric modeling;Missiles;Aerospace engineering","digital simulation;military computing;systems engineering;weapons","simulation requirements;weapon analysis;modern complex aerospace systems;MBSE tools;conceptual modelling;MBSE based methodology;combat system performance;standard analysis principles;entire combat system;weapon system kill chain;required traceability;WSAF methodology;combat system modelling;model-based system engineering;whole-of-system analytical framework","","3","","20","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) is an effective approach to address security requirements and risk assessment at the early stages of the development life cycle, which enables cost-efficient fixes. The aim of this work is to investigate how cybersecurity risk assessment could be integrated into model-based requirement engineering.

If aligned to a Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), like the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) Technical Standard [3], and if aligned to Military Aircraft Airworthiness Qualification efforts, the lifecycle artifacts can be used and reused across a fleet of dissimilar aircraft systems, enhancing aircraft capabilities across the battlespace [4]. The Open Group FACE Consortium [https://www.opengroup.org/face] has long requested metrics regarding time savings and level of effort (LOE) using the Modular Open Systems Approach described by the FACE Approach. This paper presents three (3) working use cases of using the TES-SAVi AWESUM® MBSE tool suite converting FACE Technical Standard data models. AWESUM® now has the capability to convert software developed to the FACE Technical Standard from Standard, Editions 2.x to 3, up to the interface validation process. Designed as a complete lifecycle tools suite, AWESUM® has the ability to address the complete lifecycle objectives described by DO-178C, support software aligned to the FACE Technical Standard, and support Military Airworthiness Qualification processes [5]. The use cases reported within this paper include the conversion of the BALSA (Basic Avionics Lightweight Source Archetype) User Supplied Model (USM) v2 with ~100 data elements to USM v3; secondly, the v2 to v3 conversion of a US Army Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) topic requesting common reusable FACE development efforts, namely the Army Common Engine FADEC Interface (CEFI) FACE component, which was intentionally designed to leverage BALSA as its starting point for design; and thirdly a sizable real-world application, the conversion of a Raytheon Missile Systems' (RMS) program with ~15,000 data elements. This third product is a FACE Domain Specific Data Model (DSDM) awarded FACE Conformance Certification in April 2019 to FACE Technical Standard, Edition 2.1.

In the future, as humans and machines learn and co-adapt in their mission context, systems engineering must develop approaches that support dynamic analysis and synthesis in both the design and operation of systems. The concept of a “digital (mission) twin” provides an integration framework for design and control of future complex cyber-physical-human SoS. The framework builds on mission function task (MFT) analysis, providing a basis for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) activities to identify and address needs for automation or other forms of advanced technology that improve overall system performance. However, human-driven adaptation and eventually machine adaptation of complex SoS poses organizational and methodological challenges. We discuss the need for and opportunities for convergence of three often segregated SE methodologies: product engineering, human systems integration, and mission/operations analysis by expanding the product or process engineering view of a digital twin to the mission level. In the present this gives us a framework to analyze and specify automation and adaptation opportunities at the mission level. In the future we envision this twin continuously operates with the real systems to manage both emergent mission conditions and lifecycle adaptation.

Each of these stakeholders has a specific view on the system under design. Unfortunately, when designers create artefacts in their different views in a concurrent manner, the integration of the different views may reveal inconsistencies. This leads to time consuming, iterative design processes where inconsistencies are resolved, in turn possibly creating new ones. It is hence necessary to reason explicitly about the view-specific properties that depend on, and influence properties of other views. This enables consistency during integration and reduces the development time and effort. In this paper we formalise the interrelationships between the different views, in the context of different design processes, to allow designers to meaningfully and efficiently manage inconsistencies. Our formalisation introduces ontological domain properties and their relations as the link between the view-specific properties used by the stakeholders. Thus, our approach combines the state of the art of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Semantic Web. The relevance of this approach is demonstrated by means of a motivating example.","","978-1-5090-1156-8","10.1109/CPPS.2016.7483922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483922","","Pragmatics;Stakeholders;Hardware;Ontologies;Cognition;Semantics;Context","concurrency (computers);cyber-physical systems;formal specification;semantic Web;systems engineering","ontological reasoning;consistency;cyber-physical systems;system under design;concurrent manner;iterative design processes;view-specific properties;ontological domain properties;model-based systems engineering;semantic Web","","11","","28","IEEE","2 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This vision (called the ""F6"" program) seeks to explore distributed spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest to this study was ""Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?"" Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices. The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments. It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter® framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs) and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated with the use cases under evaluation. A number of models were developed to support these evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena® (a commercial discrete-event simulation software product). The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations between high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used to generate the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based transformation process will be critical for exploring the large decision trade spaces in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents the results of the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches used to model the problem, explore the tradespace, refine the exploration, and generate results. We also discuss possible directions for future work. Specifically, it should be noted that while the approach described herein is being developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general applicability to a much wider variety of applications.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187435","","Business;Computer architecture;Space vehicles;Switches;Modeling;Fractionation;Mathematical model","aerospace instrumentation;mathematics computing;space vehicles","model-based systems engineering;Arena;Matlab;Excel;operational value metrics;implementation value metrics;Phoenix Integration's Model Center;net present value;technology obsolescence;monolithic architectures;monolithic spacecrafts;distributed spacecraft architectures;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;DARPA's F6 program;business case tool;fractionated spacecraft system","","10","","7","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RFD process combines Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to manage system modeling complexity and formal methods to ensure that designs are verifiably correct against their requirements. It consists of a set of levels of abstraction. Each level of abstraction represents a set of requirements and its associated models, simulations, and the relationship between them. Abstraction and refinement functions relate different levels of representation. In this paper, we represent and analyze the RFD process using category theory. Category theory provides us a means (using a collection of objects and arrows) to represent each level of abstractions and communications between them. We represent each level of abstraction using a pullback categorical structure (define the objects and morphisms). The facts and theorems in one level of abstraction will be passed to another via a refinement or an abstraction functor (function). The two functors operate in an inverse (adjoint) relationship. This means refinement traceability is met in the design process fundamentally. Additionally, since adjunction is a weaker relation than any other relations (such as equality, isomorphism, and equivalence) between two categories, it is a relatively better option for relaxing the design space. Finally, we introduce an idea of defining a category of refinements (i.e. a category of functors) and interpreting the universal properties.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-3664-0","10.1109/SYSCON.2018.8369508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8369508","","Analytical models;Systems modeling;Complexity theory;Algebra;Electronic mail","category theory;communication complexity;formal specification","category theory;RFD process;system modeling complexity;formal methods;abstraction functor;Responsive and Formal Design process;Model-Based Systems Engineering","","4","","31","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to test those tools, the automated generation of well-formed (or intentionally malformed) graph models is necessitated which is often carried out by solver-based model generation techniques. In many model generation scenarios, one needs more refined control over the generated unit tests to focus on the more relevant models. Type scopes allow to precisely define the required number of newly generated elements, thus one can avoid the generation of unrealistic and highly symmetric models having only a single type of elements. In this paper, we propose a 3-valued scoped partial modeling formalism, which innovatively extends partial graph models with predicate abstraction and counter abstraction. As a result, well-formedness constraints and multiplicity requirements can be evaluated in an approximated way on incomplete (unfinished) models by using advanced graph query engines with numerical solvers (e.g., IP or LP solvers). Based on the refinement of 3-valued scoped partial models, we propose an efficient model generation algorithm that generates models that are both well-formed and satisfy the scope requirements. We show that the proposed approach scales significantly better than existing SAT-solver techniques or the original graph solver without multiplicity reasoning. We illustrate our approach in a complex design-space exploration case study of collaborating satellites introduced by researchers at NASA JPL.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3025732","BME-Artificial Intelligence FIKP(grant numbers:EMMI (BME FIKP-MI/SC)); NKFIH Hungary(grant numbers:BME NC TKP2020); Nemzeti Kutatási, Fejlesztési és Innovaciós Alap; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-04573-16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201551","Domain-specific architectures;graphs and networks;logic and constraint programming;model validation and analysis","Numerical models;Tools;Object oriented modeling;Generators;Unified modeling language;Biological system modeling","computability;graph theory;program testing;program verification;query processing;systems engineering","newly generated elements;unrealistic models;highly symmetric models;partial modeling formalism;partial graph models;multiplicity requirements;incomplete models;advanced graph query engines;numerical solvers;partial models;efficient model generation algorithm;scope requirements;SAT-solver techniques;original graph solver;multiplicity reasoning;automated generation;consistent graph models;advanced tools;model-based systems engineering;solver-based model generation techniques;model generation scenarios;generated unit tests","","3","","91","CCBY","21 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, even though all relevant discipline-specific models can be integrated into one system model, how to maintain consistency between a discipline-specific model and the central system model during model updates still needs to be considered. In this paper, an approach for automatic synchronization of a discipline-specific model i.e. mechanical CAD model and the central SysML-based model i.e. a SysML4 Mechatronics plant model, is introduced.

This paper describes the flight computer for the PL&HA payload that will be used in SPLICE flight testing onboard suborbital rockets. This computer is being designed as a surrogate architecture for the HPSC chip, using a Xilinx Multi-Processor System on a Chip (MPSoC). Field testing with the surrogate architecture facilitates cross-agency experience with the HPSC and positions projects for future technology infusion opportunities. The MPSoC is hosted on a custom baseboard and interfaced to a second custom board that provides the sensor and vehicle interfaces. Early design trades for the SPLICE surrogate implementation are described. Preliminary performance testing on the surrogate platform using an optical navigation algorithm developed for the Orion vehicle is described, and shows 2.5 times execution speedup resulting from minimal modifications to the original code. In general, High Performance Computing/Embedded Computing (HPC/HPEC) required to address computational challenges in a wide range of NASA missions has consistently had challenges in implementation due to the diversity in the disciplines required to develop a solution. Typically, algorithm designers with expertise in the physics of the problem, and numeric approaches to solving the relations that model the physics, do not have expertise in processing architectures. There are strong dependencies between the overall performance of the system and the choices made in the modeling of the physics, the numerical approaches to solutions for the physical relations, and how these operations are mapped to computational resources in an architecture. To address this concern, a Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) based concept for conducting multi-disciplinary co-design of the Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GN&C) algorithms, processing hardware configuration, and system software is introduced.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8741888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741888","","Navigation;Computational modeling;NASA;Computer architecture;Hazards;Numerical models;System-on-chip","aerospace computing;aerospace instrumentation;embedded systems;entry, descent and landing (spacecraft);field programmable gate arrays;mobile robots;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;planetary rovers;space vehicles;systems engineering","multicore processor;future human spaceflight missions;robotic spaceflight missions;flight computer;PL&HA payload;SPLICE flight testing onboard suborbital rockets;HPSC chip;MPSoC;field testing;surrogate architecture facilitates cross-agency experience;positions projects;future technology infusion opportunities;custom baseboard;custom board;sensor;vehicle interfaces;design trades;SPLICE surrogate implementation;preliminary performance testing;surrogate platform;optical navigation algorithm;computational challenges;NASA missions;numerical approaches;computational resources;multidisciplinary co-design;precision landing;hazard avoidance;co-design approach;execution speedup;model-based systems engineering based concept;high performance computing-embedded computing;Xilinx multiprocessor system;NASA computing platform;high-performance space computing project;NASA technology development","","1","","14","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are autonomous aerial robots that come in a wide variety of basic frameworks and particular specifications. Thus, a swarm of UAVs is a collection of aerial vehicles that work together to achieve a specific goal. However, the design of UAVs swarms is a complex process. Therefore, in this paper we propose a continuous approach to the design a swarm of UAVs based on the model-based systems engineering (MBSE) method. This approach consists of three design levels; the swarm Modeling level, the swarm simulation level and the swarm implementation level. Indeed, we have created a new Systems Modeling Language (SysML) model using Domain Specific Language (DSL) to model the swarm mission, the hardware specifications of the UAV swarms and the software implementation of the swarm system. We called this model “UavSwarmML”. Subsequently, we used in the simulation phase Robot Operating System (ROS) as a middleware to simulate and implement our swarm system to validate the developed models. A case study of an autonomous UAV swarm flight mission was chosen to validate this design approach and illustrate its contributions to the efficient design of UAV swarms.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-3992-3","10.1109/SysCon53536.2022.9773922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773922","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);SysML model;Domain Specific Language (DSL);Aerial swarm robots;ROS.","Pattern formation;Surveillance;Operating systems;Swarm robotics;Computer architecture;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Systems Modeling Language","autonomous aerial vehicles;middleware;mobile robots;remotely operated vehicles;specification languages;systems engineering;telerobotics","unmanned aerial vehicles;autonomous aerial robots;particular specifications;UAVs swarms;model-based systems engineering method;design levels;swarm Modeling level;swarm simulation level;swarm implementation level;Systems Modeling Language model;Domain Specific Language;swarm mission;UAV swarms;swarm system;model UavSwarmML;simulation phase Robot Operating System;autonomous UAV swarm flight mission;SysML model;particular vehicles;teleoperated robots;autonomous robots;UAV swarm Modeling","","1","","32","IEEE","16 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The initial Block 1 configuration for Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1)will be capable of lofting at least 70 metric tons (t)of payload and send the Orion crew vehicle into a distant retrograde lunar orbit, paving the way for future crew missions to cislunar space and eventually Mars. A Block 1B version of SLS will lift at least 34 t to trans-lunar injection (TLI)in its crew configuration and at least 37 t to TLI in its cargo configuration no earlier than 2024. For Mars-class payloads, larger fairings and payload adapters for the Block 2 cargo vehicle are under consideration. For missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, SLS offers greater characteristic energy (C3)than any other launch vehicle, enabling shorter transit times or heavier payloads with more robust science packages for missions to the outer solar system. Indeed, the unmatched combination of thrust, payload volume and departure energy that SLS provides opens new opportunities for human and robotic exploration of deep space. To support the delivery of infrastructure on all of these flights, a family of SLS Payload Adapters (PLA)is being developed to provide ELV class (1575-mm, 2624-mm, 4394-mm)and larger spacecraft/payload interfaces for both crewed (Orion)and cargo (fairing)missions. These PLAs also provide the potential of accommodating various configurations of 6U, 12U and 27U Secondary Payloads (SPL). Work on demonstrating the manufacturing of these 8.4-m diameter composite structures is already in progress at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, which manages the SLS Program. Because of the many potential configurations required to support SLS missions ranging from sending Europa Clipper to Jovian space to establishing a lunar orbiting Gateway, there is a critical need for establishing the fewest PLA designs that can accommodate the most SLS payloads possible. This paper will summarize applications from a NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC)led Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)pathfinder activity to develop a “digital” PLA feasibility assessment approach. This approach will help potential users optimize their interface to SLS by providing analysts with the means to reduce PLA feasibility definition cycle time/effort by over 75%. This also allows more feasibility assessment “turns” available to single and multiple payload elements on a single SLS launch. This translates into providing users with options that allows them to optimize upmass available to payload versus being required for PLA structure.","1095-323X","978-1-5386-6854-2","10.1109/AERO.2019.8742087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8742087","","Payloads;Space vehicles;Moon;Programmable logic arrays;Logic gates;Space missions;Trajectory","Mars;space vehicles","digital PLA feasibility assessment approach;single payload elements;multiple payload elements;single SLS launch;deep space human spaceflight;Kennedy Space Center;crew missions;PLA designs;NASA Engineering and Safety Center;NASA Space Launch System;NASA exploration-class launch vehicle;PLA feasibility definition cycle time;Model Based Systems Engineering pathfinder activity;spacecraft-payload interfaces;cargo configuration;Jovian space;SLS missions;SLS Program;Marshall Space Flight Center;ELV class;SLS Payload Adapters;robotic exploration;human exploration;departure energy;payload volume;outer solar system;heavier payloads;Earth-Moon system;Block 2 cargo vehicle;Mars-class payloads;crew configuration;trans-lunar injection;Block 1B version;cislunar space;distant retrograde lunar orbit;Orion crew vehicle;Exploration Mission 1;initial Block 1 configuration","","1","","3","IEEE","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A formal model of TCAS in the model-checking language NuSMV provides an output oracle. We compare test sets generated using various methods, including covering arrays, random, and a low-complexity input paradigm applied to 28 versions of the TCAS C program containing seeded errors. Faults are triggered by tests for all 28 programs using a combination of covering arrays and random input generation. Complexity-based inputs perform more efficiently than covering arrays, and can be paired with random input generation to create efficient and effective test sets.

PROVE Pathfinder's aim is to image volcanic ash plumes from several different locations and aspects along its orbital trajectory. These images will be used to gain more knowledge of the ash cloud, useful in protecting civil aviation in the case of large-scale volcanic eruptions with ash associated. As CubeSats have historically suffered from a high failure rate, a thorough understanding of the reliability of the PROVE Pathfinder system is essential to mitigating the mission risk. This paper presents the analysis, results and recommended failure mitigation strategies from a reliability study carried out on the PROVE Pathfinder payload system. Several different analysis approaches were used to study the reliability of the system. These included Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Monte Carlo simulation and a reliability model of PROVE Pathfinder devised using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Various estimates of system reliability were produced, with a final figure of 80% reliability. This estimate took account of the numerous mitigation strategies identified during the study, including cold redundancy in payload controllers and aluminum radiation shielding. While some discrepancies in qualitative reliability estimates were found, the insight gained during the study greatly assisted with identifying mitigation strategies and generally improved system reliability. A framework for reliability analysis approaches and mitigation strategy identification for general use on spacecraft systems is proposed, with opportunity for future development.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843234","","Analytical models;Monte Carlo methods;Redundancy;Aluminum;Ash;Behavioral sciences;Reliability","aerospace safety;ash;failure analysis;fault trees;Monte Carlo methods;reliability;risk management;space vehicles;systems engineering;volcanology","different analysis approaches;Fault Tree Analysis;reliability model;Model Based Systems Engineering;system reliability;numerous mitigation strategies;payload controllers;qualitative reliability estimates;reliability analysis approaches;mitigation strategy identification;spacecraft systems;PROVE Pathfinder CubeSat payload;6U CubeSat;PROVE Pathfinder's aim;image volcanic ash plumes;orbital trajectory;ash cloud;civil aviation;large-scale volcanic eruptions;CubeSats;high failure rate;PROVE Pathfinder system;recommended failure mitigation strategies;reliability study;PROVE Pathfinder payload system","","","","29","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SoSs involve primarily combination of hardware and software, as well as humans and organizations. The need to teach model-based system-of-systems engineering has thus raised the need to determine what the most suitable language for modeling and teaching SoSs is. We developed a new course format, in which groups jointly reverse-engineer and model Web-based information systems in two different modeling languages, UML and OPM, and then individually assess their peers' projects. The goal of this study was to compare UML with OPM as two candidates. We developed and evaluated an online peer assessment tool which students used. About 130 undergraduate students in groups of six divided into teams of three modeled 23 systems in both UML and OPM. They then evaluated, compared, and ranked the clarity & understandability and the completeness of the four models of two systems that their peers had constructed. Findings demonstrate that neither the order of the models assessment nor the assessor gender affected the grading, indicating assessment reliability. We found significant differences in model clarity and understandability in favor of OPM and no differences in completeness between OPM and UML models. These findings validate our approach of teaching both conceptual modeling languages and using peer assessment in large-scale project-based undergraduate information systems engineering courses.","2154-4824","978-1-8893-3549-0","10.1109/WAC.2014.6936160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936160","Unified Modeling Langugae (UML);Object-Process Methodology (OPM);model-based systems enginering (MBSE);model-based systems-of-systems enginering (MBSSE);conceive-design-integrate-operate (CDIO);large scale assessment;project-based learning (PBL);systems engineering education","Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Analysis of variance;Modems;Lead;Visualization;Documentation","computer aided instruction;computer science education;engineering education;further education;information systems;Internet;reverse engineering;systems engineering;teaching;Unified Modeling Language","model-based systems-of-systems engineering;MBSSE;model-based system engineering teaching;research and development;SoSs;reverse-engineer;Web-based information systems;online peer assessment tool;undergraduate students;assessor gender;assessment reliability;model assessment;OPM models;UML models;conceptual modeling languages;large-scale project-based undergraduate information system engineering courses;object-process methodology;unified modeling language","","2","","30","","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most research in this area usually only focuses on general system descriptions of a step in the system development process, without providing any interdisciplinary or interprocess connections. Thus, the models created by the domain experts are often unconnected and not suited for automated model transformations. We present a method to integrate abstract system descriptions in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models, which are not only the primary model for geometrical hardware descriptions but also the starting point of most process chains in the context of virtual product development. The transformations of our method are realized in a plug-in for the MagicDraw modeling environment and support to generate parameters of a parameter and constraint CAD modeling approach from a SysML model.

Their unique combination of efficient capabilities, resource-friendly design and inherent robustness makes them attractive as a mission element at the frontiers of exploration of the solar system by larger spacecraft as well as stand-alone low-cost approaches to open up the solar system for a broader range of interests. The operators' requirements for cutting-edge missions compatible with available launch capabilities impose significant constraints in resources, timelines, timeliness, mass and size. To create spacecraft feasible within these constraints, the mission design teams need to accept a broad range of equipment maturity levels from fresh concepts to off-the-shelf units. The resulting Constraints-Driven Engineering (CDE) environment has led to new methods which transcend traditional evenly-paced and sequential development. We evolved and extended Concurrent Design and Engineering (CD/CE) methods originally incepted for initial studies into Concurrent Assembly, Integration and Verification (CAIV). It is applied in all phases in most of our projects to achieve convergence of asynchronous subsystem maturity timelines and to match parallel tracks of integration and test campaigns.

Therefore, a systematic development methodology for complex systems based on a holistic approach is required. As part of this research, Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) integrating the System Modeling Language (SysML) is applied for the development of a HVDC grid connection for OWFs. With this methodology it is possible to develop a detailed system model for a case study step by step, considering stakeholder objectives, constraints and requirements. SysML allows the creation of an abstract system model allowing an appropriate design in the early project phase while avoiding costly late changes. This paper focuses as a first step on the requirement engineering with a subsequent conceptual design of the grid connection system and provides a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) improved and efficient system concept as a result.","","978-3-8007-5549-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9469685","","","","","","","","","","1 Jul 2021","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

We have developed a tool and method to produce sophisticated artifacts as views and by-products of integrated models, allowing us to minimize the practice of “Power-Point Engineering” from model-based projects and demonstrate the ability of MBSE to work within and supersede traditional engineering practices. This paper describes how we have created and successfully used model-based document generation techniques to extract paper artifacts from complex SysML and UML models in support of successful project reviews. Use of formal SysML and UML models for architecture and system design enables production of review documents, textual artifacts, and analyses that are consistent with one-another and require virtually no labor-intensive maintenance across small-scale design changes and multiple authors. This effort thus enables approaches that focus more on rigorous engineering work and less on “PowerPoint engineering” and production of paper-based documents or their “office-productivity” file equivalents.","1095-323X","978-1-4244-7351-9","10.1109/AERO.2011.5747541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5747541","","Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Software;Generators;XML;Computer architecture","formal specification;formal verification;software architecture;systems engineering;text analysis;Unified Modeling Language","model based system engineering;power point engineering;dynamic gate product;model based document generation technique;SysML;UML;system architecture;system design;textual artifact","","15","","7","IEEE","11 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Model-based off-nominal state isolation and detection system for autonomous fault management","K. Kolcio; L. Fesq","Okean Solutions, Inc., Seattle, WA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA","2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference","30 Jun 2016","2016","","","1","13","This paper presents a model-based fault management (FM) system designed to provide off-nominal state detection and isolation capabilities that are key components to assessing spacecraft state awareness. The ability to autonomously isolate spacecraft failures to component levels will enable faster and more targeted responses and recovery thereby reducing down time. The use of model-based systems and practices is being explored by the FM community as a viable approach to developing more capable, autonomous systems in order to meet mission objectives. Model-based systems can provide better fault identification than traditional methods of fault detection such as limit-checking. They also lend themselves to more straight-forward approaches to verification and validation. We have chosen a particular model-based technique called Constraint Suspension for autonomous fault detection and isolation that does not require explicit fault modeling. The system is composed of a diagnostic engine and nominal system models of the target application, for example sensors and actuators. Sensed data are propagated through models of nominal system behavior. Faults are diagnosed when inconsistencies arise between sensed and modeled data. Several benefits result from this choice. First, because knowledge of faulty behavior is not required, it is possible to detect unanticipated and unforeseen faults. In fact, anomalous, degraded, and failed states all can be detected. Second, the same models used for nominal analyses and operations can be re-used for fault management, saving development resources and time. Third, the core diagnostic engine algorithm is complete and requires no additions to accommodate a potentially growing number of faults over time resulting in a relatively compact software footprint. Related to the second and third points is that the core algorithm and, potentially, models can be reused from mission to mission. Finally, the system can be used early in the design phase as a tool for sensor placement analyses and model verification. Health information produced by the FM system can be used to make resource allocation and planning and scheduling decisions by ground operations or by other on-board autonomy agents. Autonomous fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) on board space vehicles will provide protection and increased mission availability and reliability. On the ground such systems enable lights-out monitoring as well as training and support for operators. This paper presents the development of fault detection and isolation algorithms and models. Application of the system to a spacecraft attitude control system is discussed. Finally we apply Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) modeling patterns to the fault management system models as a way to facilitate the development of the models through the use of SysML.","","978-1-4673-7676-1","10.1109/AERO.2016.7500793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500793","","Space vehicles;Hardware;Monitoring;Data models;Frequency modulation;Sensors","aerospace computing;space vehicles;SysML","off nominal state isolation;detection system;autonomous fault management;FM system;spacecraft state awareness;autonomously isolate spacecraft failures;constraint suspension;explicit fault modeling;diagnostic engine;nominal system models;target application;core diagnostic engine algorithm;sensor placement analyses;health information;autonomous fault detection isolation and recovery;SysML","","15","","7","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a core task, model checking explores the state space of the system model to generate counter-examples which describe system state sequences not meeting safety requirements. Although these sequences are useful for safety analysis, we still need to get the traditional safety artifacts such as a fault tree to keep the conclusion complete. Many studies have focused on how to generate fault trees from the counter-example automatically. However, there are some disadvantages in the existing generation methods. For instance, the generated fault tree contains many branch redundancies making the respective tree broad and difficult to understand, which limits the effectiveness and efficiency of the model checking technique. Based on investigating model checking mechanisms and counter-example forms, and combined with the traditional fault tree algorithm, this paper proposed a new optimized method that can translate the system state sequence obtained from the counter-example in NuSMV into a fault tree. By analyzing system operation process and function flow, and considering system hierarchical decomposition as well, the structure of the generated fault tree can be optimized, including redundant nodes removing and dimensions reducing, to improve its logical hierarchy and readability. Finally, a case study about airborne equipment is provided to demonstrate and validate the proposed method.","","978-1-5090-0249-8","10.1109/RAMS.2016.7447981","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447981","model checking;counter-example;reachable states;NuSMV;FTA","Safety;Fault trees;Model checking;Fuels;Systems modeling;Analytical models;Redundancy","aerospace components;aerospace computing;aerospace safety;fault trees;formal verification;fuel systems;systems engineering","model based system engineering;model-based safety analysis techniques;model-based safety analysis process;system modeling;safety properties verification;system state sequences;safety requirements;fault tree generation;branch redundancies;model checking technique;counter-example forms;fault tree algorithm;NuSMV;system operation process;function flow;system hierarchical decomposition;logical hierarchy;readability;airborne equipment;aircraft fuel systems","","1","","12","IEEE","7 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, one of a development program’s first goals is to converge on achievable system design requirements that satisfy the customer’s functional and performance needs. Part of this system design requirements development activity is quantifying risks and risk mitigations associated with the requirements, where risk mitigation may include creating new requirements or changing existing requirements. Conducting a Requirements Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) during this early stage of development is an excellent way of reviewing and cutting potential gaps or ambiguous requirements that lead to out-of-program-phase rework. This paper explains what a Requirements FMEA is and its key steps using practical examples. Furthermore, this paper will show the reader how to perform a Requirements FMEA using Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) methods for even greater benefits.","2577-0993","978-1-6654-6053-8","10.1109/RAMS51473.2023.10088237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10088237","Failure Modes and Effects Analysis;Requirements Analysis;Risk Mitigation","Analytical models;Databases;Random access memory;Reliability engineering;Risk management;System analysis and design","","","","","","7","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Systems engineering, an integrative discipline on which the contributions of many disciplines are evaluated against each other, may particularly benefit from research in communication methods. Specifically, storytelling may be beneficial to engineers because it enables sense-making. Research into storytelling is conducted to identify storytelling metrics that could be useful in engineering communication, specifically engineering case studies. Literature review: Although storytelling has been identified in past research as possibly useful to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and software requirement writing, a rigorous study of the use of storytelling elements in systems engineering communication has not been performed. Research question: How are storytelling elements currently being applied in engineering case studies? Research methodology: Twelve interdisciplinary metrics from storytelling, content analysis, and engineering are identified from the literature and used to characterize a collection of 48 NASA case studies. The values of the metrics for each case study are determined and analyzed using statistical and content analyses. Results and discussion: Analysis of the 12 metrics indicates that the case study design region with a historical backstory structure, climactic plot structure, and early points of attack is most frequently used by designers. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that certain storytelling elements applied in engineering case studies are used more frequently. Further work is needed to leverage the metrics as design variables in engineering case study writing.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2021.3064394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418525","Case study;content analysis;design;storytelling","Measurement;NASA;Writing;Stakeholders;Content management;Design methodology;Communication systems","aerospace computing;software metrics;software tools;systems engineering","engineering case study writing;case study design region;systems engineering communication;storytelling elements;software requirement;engineering case studies;storytelling metrics;engineered systems;analyze NASA case studies;identifying multidisciplinary metrics","","1","","70","IEEE","28 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These architectures are then individually evaluated on each parameter of interest, with the results manually compared. Measures of effectiveness (typically dealing with technical performance) and cost are independently analyzed per DoD guidance. Based on advances in model-based systems engineering (MBSE), systems architecting best practices, and analytical tools, we propose a better option to conduct a multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) for the parameters of interest, including cost, to generate the architecture that presents the best value for the government while meeting affordability and performance constraints. This allows for more potential architectures to be evaluated quickly and can lead to the identification of the most promising architectures that may not have been identified utilizing more traditional manual methods. MDO can also be demonstrated to have greater transparency, more robust uncertainty analysis, and increased flexibility in adapting to scope changes in the evaluation than a more manual approach. In this research, a satellite architecture trade study analyzing disaggregation, modular satellite development, and alternative orbits was conducted with the more manual technique per current AoA guidance, and the MDO technique utilizing the ModelCenter™ tool developed by Phoenix Integration, Inc. The results of the techniques were compared and demonstrated how MDO can capture extra value from an architecture trade study, in particular an AoA, than a more manual process. In addition, the techniques themselves were compared on the basis of cost, level of effort, uncertainty, transparency, and flexibility with the intent of identifying improved DoD guidance for MDAP acquisitions.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396526","","Stakeholders","artificial satellites;military computing;military systems;software architecture;systems engineering","DoD guidance;systems engineering;multidisciplinary optimization;satellite architecture trade study;modular satellite development;MDO technique;MDAP acquisitions;DoD acquisitions;AoA guidance;analysis of alternatives process;major defense acquisition program","","3","","25","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A rule-based tool for science traceability of Mars exploration mission architectures","S. S. De León; D.

Recently, the science traceability and alignment framework (STAF) was proposed as an improvement over the STM. One limitation of both approaches used for traceability purposes is that they must be manually completed by experts and thus cannot be used to compare many alternatives as done in trade space exploration. This can be addressed to some extent using formal modeling languages such as SysML and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) tools, which can automatically construct tables showing traceability between requirements. However, despite the presence of parametric diagrams, it is still challenging to quantify how changes in the system architecture affect requirement satisfaction. Here, the authors present a knowledge-based tool that can address both needs: given a system architecture, it can generate traceability hierarchies similar to the ones in STM and STAF while also providing a quantitative assessment of requirement satisfaction. This executable STM is implemented as a rule-based system that uses a database of measurement requirements for a given mission. Upon execution, the tool provides not only a score but also a rationale for full or degraded satisfaction of the mission requirements. As an example, the three Mars mission architectures proposed in the Decadal Survey were evaluated. Traceability to the objectives established by the Decadal Survey along with the science value achieved by each concept and the rationale for why the missions cannot satisfy certain measurements were generated.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396804","","Mars;Extraterrestrial measurements;Tools;Meteorology;Sea measurements;NASA","aerospace computing;formal specification;formal verification;space research;space vehicles;systems engineering","science traceability matrix;Mars mission architectures;mission requirements;executable STM;traceability hierarchies;systems engineering tools;formal modeling languages;trade space exploration;traceability purposes;science mission architecture;Mars exploration mission architectures","","","","16","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Post Jupiter-Orbit- Insertion, the spacecraft will be commanded to perform intricate, yet meticulously planned Europa flybys to perform science investigations using a suite of instruments, while withstanding Jupiter's harsh radiation environment. The success of this mission is dependent on a well-coordinated project and its elements such as the flight hardware and software, the ground support and mission operations teams, procedures and other cross-cutting elements. The Europa Clipper project needs to ensure that these elements are realized at a reasonable confidence level prior to launch and other mission critical events. System Validation test and analysis activities exercise and confirm the integrity of the system of all project elements in the expected flight environment with reasonable stressing conditions. These activities go beyond system design requirements verification and are driven by validation objectives that describe the end-to-end functional and operational capabilities required during nominal and off-nominal flight-like scenarios and critical events. The challenges associated with validating that the Europa Clipper project as a whole can function and perform correctly to meet the intended mission objectives with the as-delivered capabilities of all of its elements are daunting. This paper discusses the systematic methodology established in the early implementation phase of the Europa Clipper project for developing System Validation activities and their validation objectives, and addressing any validation-related challenges on the project. Approaches include decomposition of mission objectives using activity timelines in the Mission Design plan for developing nominal scenarios, use of fault trees for exploring off-nominal cases and system boundaries, and use of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) tools for planning and prioritizing these activities.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438442","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438442","","Space vehicles;Jupiter;Systematics;Tools;Hardware;Software;Planning","Jupiter;planetary atmospheres;planetary satellites;space vehicles","Europa Clipper mission;highly capable spacecraft;Europa flybys;cross-cutting elements;Europa Clipper project;mission critical events;project elements;expected flight environment;system design requirements verification;intended mission objectives;validation-related challenges;Mission Design plan;system validation activities;NASA next flagship mission;Jupiter harsh radiation environment;Post Jupiter-Orbit-Insertion;Jupiter icy moon Europa","","","","4","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
