abstract = {Abstract Although Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is quickly becoming adopted in Systems Engineering (SE), there have not been many studies evaluating literature to determine the perceived value of implementing MBSE. This research first identifies and discusses previous studies on the justification or rejection of MBSE. This study investigates how the SE community perceives the value of MBSE by coding and analyzing positive and negative descriptions of MBSE; perceived benefits and drawbacks of implementing MBSE; and the evidence and metrics used to substantiate and measure each claim about MBSE. From 60 academic sources, this study collected and coded over 2900 claims on MBSE. Our findings determine the most positive attributes of MBSE to be Verification \& Validation Capability, Consistency, Reasoning, and Risk \& Error Manageability, while the most negative attributes were Approach Understandability, Acceptability, Familiarity, and Approach Complexity. The most-stated benefits were Reduced Time, Better Communication/Information Sharing, Reduced Costs, and Better Analysis Capability. The most claimed drawbacks were Increased Costs, Increased Time, Increased Effort, and Worsened Capability. A large share of claims (47\%) about MBSE was based on author opinions. Most claims (86\%) were not substantiated by a metric.},

The paper is based on a survey of how MBSE has been applied and factors that influenced the perceived benefits and results. The survey was designed to evaluate the maturity and status of the implementation of MBSE (also called model-centric systems engineering), within industry, academia, and governments. The approach to the survey development is described along with the survey results. The study indicates that one of the main hurdles to introducing a model-based approach is the lack of clear and adopted organizational structures and an understanding of required conditions and needs at a management level. The survey also indicates that 50–75\% of the respondents noted some improvement or a significant improvement across almost all systems engineering tasks.},

In fact, MBSE remains a central element in the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE)’s vision for 2025. Examining systems engineering literature, this paper presents an assessment of the extent to which benefits and value of MBSE are supported by empirical evidence. A systematic review of research and practice papers in major systems engineering archival journals and conference proceedings was conducted. Evidence was categorized in four types, two of which inductively emerged from the results: measured, observed (without a formal measurement process), perceived (claimed without evidence), and backed by other references. Results indicate that two thirds of claimed MBSE benefits are only supported by perceived evidence, while only two papers reported measured evidence. The aggregate assessment presented in this paper indicates that claims about the value and benefits of MBSE are mainly based on expectation. We argue that evidence supporting the value and benefits of MBSE remains inconclusive.},

This paper presents an approach using DoDAF. Visual accessibility of the DoDAF views facilitates full participation by all system stakeholders, including the customers, developers, and implementers, and enables the necessary dialogue. The approach promotes communications among the members of the development team and speeds up the iterations of the systems engineering process.

With the projected growth in launch cadence of small-lift rockets in the coming decade, there is a need to design increasingly complex launch systems with greater efficiency. The potential improvements in project communication, quality, and productivity are explored by developing a model following the ISO/IEC 15288 technical process framework and the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) methodology. The stakeholder requirements are defined and analyzed to provide traceability to individual systems and subsystems. An architecture is proposed by generating engineering artifacts such as piping and instrumentation drawings.

abstract = {Abstract As systems continue to grow in scale and complexity, the Systems Engineering community has turned to Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to manage complexity, maintain consistency, and assure traceability during system development. It is different from “engineering with models,” which has been a common practice in the engineering profession for decades. MBSE is a holistic, systems engineering approach centered on the evolving system model, which serves as the “sole source of truth” about the system. It comprises system specification, design, validation, and configuration management. Even though MBSE is beginning to see a fair amount of use in multiple industries, specific advances are needed on multiple fronts to realize its full benefits. This paper discusses the motivation for MBSE, and its current state of maturity. It presents systems modeling methodologies and the role of ontologies and metamodels in MBSE. It presents model-based verification and validation (V\&V) as an example of MBSE use. An illustrative example of the use of MBSE for design synthesis is presented to demonstrate an important MBSE capability. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges to widescale adoption and offers promising research directions to fully realize the potential benefits of MBSE.},

abstract = {Abstract An observed increase in systems scale and complexity has led to a significant momentum in exploring, identifying, and adopting model based systems engineering (MBSE) tools and techniques amongst research communities and industry practitioners. Several attempts to transform systems design and engineering practices through the use of MBSE in academia and industry has led to a considerable increase in the number of articles published containing the keyword “MBSE.” This growth serves as the motivation in this paper to explore the MBSE landscape with the help of text mining techniques to identify the most often used key terms, tools, and languages, in the context of research in MBSE and the thematic aspects defining the use of MBSE by researchers and practitioners. The objective of this paper is to provide a structured comprehensive overview of research contributions across the MBSE landscape by employing text mining techniques for: (a) identifying the concepts and methodologies inferred upon in relation to MBSE, and (b) classifying the literature published to identify commonalities across academic researchers and practitioners using MBSE tools and methods. For this purpose, the abstracts of 2380 relevant articles published in the period of the last two decades from five different databases are mined. It is found that the terms “SysML,” “Cyber Physical Systems,” and “Production” are the most used terms among researchers across the MBSE landscape with SysML being the most widely used modeling language. Further, six major thematic topics are identified that classify articles from over the last two decades with an increasing interest observed in the use of MBSE to support manufacturing and production engineering activities, especially in the cyber physical systems domain. The contributions of this paper provide a leeway on using text mining techniques to understand the research directions that are currently of interest in the field of MBSE and thereby identify potential future research directions.},

abstract = {Abstract Currently, a wide range of newly designed devices are based on high-end quantum technologies. To successfully design a quantum system, it is necessary to appropriately address the increasing complexity which exists in the development procedure of the system. A suitable approach to deal with this problem is to employ systems engineering models and integrate them with domain engineering tools. The model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methodology is commonly used to analyze, design, manufacture, and test various complex systems. In this paper, the MBSE approach is chosen for the development of quantum dot solar cells as a typical quantum system and to deal with the complexity existing in this procedure. The analysis, manufacturing, and verification, validation, and testing (VV\&T) for this system are described using SysML in Cameo Systems Modeler software to represent the role of models in this regard. Then a detailed design is performed in MATLAB and integrated with SysML to identify how changing various parameters during the system development process affects the overall system performance. This technique facilitates the communication between different engineering teams and helps to manage the complexity in the entire system lifecycle.}

abstract = {Abstract In recent years there has been increased demand for readiness and availability metrics across many industries and especially in national defense to enable data-driven decision making at all levels of planning, maintenance, and operations, and in leveraging integrated models that inform stakeholders of current operational system health and performance metrics. The digital twin (DT) has been identified as a promising approach for deploying these models to fielded systems although several challenges exist in wide adoption and implementation. Two challenges examined in this article are that the nature of DT development is a system-specific endeavor, and the development is usually an additional effort that begins after initial system fielding. A fundamental challenge with DT development, which sets it apart from traditional models, is the DT itself is treated as a separate system, and therefore the physical asset/DT construct becomes a system-of-systems problem. This article explores how objectives in DT development align with those of model-based systems engineering (MBSE), and how the MBSE process can answer questions necessary to define the DT. The key benefits to the approach are leveraging work already being performed during system synthesis and DT development is pushed earlier in a system's lifecycle. This article contributes to the definition and development processes for DTs by proposing a DT development model and path, a method for scoping and defining requirements for a DT, and an approach to integrate DT and system development. An example case study of a Naval unmanned system is presented to illustrate the contributions.},

abstract = {Abstract The model based systems engineering (MBSE) approach describes a system using consistent views to provide a holistic model as complete as possible. MBSE methodologies end with the physical architecture of the system, but a physical model is clearly incomplete without the study of its associated physical laws and phenomena related to the whole system or its parts. However, the computational demands could be excessive even for modest projects. Dimensional analysis (DA) is common in fluid dynamics and chemical engineering, but its application to systems engineering is still limited. We describe an engineering methodological process, which incorporates DA as a powerful tool to understand the physical constraints of the system without the burden of complex analytical or numerical calculations. A detailed example describing a microantenna is presented showing the benefits of this approach. The selected example describes a problem rarely covered in modern expositions of DA in order to show the wide benefit of these techniques. The information provided by this analysis is very useful to select the best physically realizable architectures, testing design, and conduct trade-off studies. The complexity of modern systems and systems of systems demands new testing procedures in order to comply with increasingly demanding requirements and regulations. This can be accomplished through research in new DA methods. Finally, this article serves as a fairly comprehensive guide to the use of DA in the context of MBSE, detailing its strengths, limitations, and controversial issues.},

To date, obsolescence management, MBSE, and modularity have been studied, advanced, and presented in a mostly disjunct manner. Consequently, work to synergize these areas specifically to mitigate obsolescence impacts is lacking. The research presented herein illuminates that the untapped synergy at the nexus of obsolescence management, MBSE, and modular design can be leveraged to enhance strategic management of obsolescence. Borrowing from the modular software engineering “container” concept6, the MBSE container modeling approach presented provides systems engineers, architects, and designers with a novel method to influence the system design by minimizing the number of system modules affected by obsolescence. By applying this model-based strategic obsolescence management approach early in the system architecting and design stages, system engineering teams can reduce the associated complexity, lifecycle costs, and risk of obsolete parts replacement.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a Generic Model-Based Systems Engineering (G-MBSE) approach based on an application of generic systems engineering principles. Firstly, these principles are defined, described and illustrated in more detail. Important artefacts are introduced that describe and characterise a system, e.g. system hierarchy, black box and white box system descriptions. Secondly, a generic systems engineering process is described within the context of a customised V-Model variant. This process is then augmented with a model-based validation/verification process to help reduce uncertainty and rework with the later design implementation. Ideally, model-based validation/verification should eliminate most of the deficiencies from, and confirm suitability of the solution/specification. Thirdly, some examples of typical artefacts required for a generic model-based implementation are presented, which have to be supported by a tool-based approach. Finally, an appraisal concludes feasibility of the proposed approach, ready for tool support.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an approach for next-generation model-based systems engineering across the system lifecycle, labelled MBSE++. This approach is based on the idea of a Total System Model that serves and evolves as the digital blueprint of a system through its lifecycle. The fundamental principles of MBSE++ are presented in this paper, including the use of decentralized and heterogeneous engineering models and repositories, spectrum of fine-grained model-based connections, unified representation of the system independent of the location of models, model transformations, comparisons, and synchronization to communicate between disciplines, and visualization and analytics for effective decision making. The motivation for each of the MBSE++ principles is presented, followed by a description of use cases. The use cases are exemplified using Syndeia, a MBE/MBSE platform developed by Intercax.},

abstract = {Abstract Constant rise in industrial usage of robots for commercial applications has led to the need for rapid, efficient, and reliable robotic system development processes. The idea of collaborative modeling and simulation provides different views to the stakeholders, enhancing the decision-making process towards design, development, and deployment. This paper 1) applies Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) principles to a robot grasping system performing a simple pick and place task, 2) integrates Cameo Systems Modeler (CSM), CoppeliaSim robot simulator, and Gurobi Optimizer to facilitate and accelerate the system design process, and 3) describes a simulation-based Verification \& Validation (V\&V) framework and performs design space exploration. This is an effort to integrate tools to reduce the burden on system design, integration, and deployment of dexterous grasping and manipulation systems.},

abstract = {Abstract Next-generation genome sequencing machines and Point-of-Care (PoC) in vitro diagnostics devices are precursors of an emerging class of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), one that harnesses biomolecular-scale mechanisms to enable novel “wet-technology” applications in medicine, biotechnology, and environmental science. Although many such applications exist, testifying the importance of innovative life-sciences instrumentation, recent events have highlighted the difficulties that designing organizations face in their attempt to guarantee safety, reliability, and performance of this special class of CPS. New regulations and increasing competition pressure innovators to rethink their design and engineering practices, and to better address the above challenges. The pace of innovation will be determined by how organizations manage to ensure the satisfaction of aforementioned constraints while also streamlining product development, maintaining high cost-efficiency and shortening time-to-market. Model-Based Systems Engineering provides a valuable framework for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing and readily available model-based development frameworks can be adopted early in the life-sciences instrumentation design process. Such frameworks are specifically helpful in describing and characterizing CPS including elements of a biological nature both at the architectural and performance level. We present the SysML model of a smartphone-based PoC diagnostics system designed for detecting a particular molecular marker. By modeling components and behaviors spanning across the biological, physical-nonbiological, and computational domains, we were able to characterize the important systemic relations involved in the specification of our system's Limit of Detection. Our results illustrate the suitability of such an approach and call for further work toward formalisms enabling the formal verification of systems including biomolecular components.},
