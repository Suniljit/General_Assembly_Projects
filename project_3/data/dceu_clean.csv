DC_Cinematic,'Shazam! Fury of the Gods' full credits are interesting (press release from WB),"Warner Bros. released a bunch of Shazam! Fury of the Gods press material this week. I shared all the [official stills and behind-the-scenes photos they released here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/11fk8fl/shazam_2_35_official_stills_and_behindthescenes/).

They also released a big PDF of all the credits. The most interesting to me was &gt;!Fake Wonder Woman!&lt;. That iconic theme song is credited too.

DC_Cinematic,Help Identifying an Unknown Draft of the Superman (1978) Script,"A lot of the drafts of the Superman (1 and 2) script are publicly available nowadays. Both Puzo drafts, a July 1976 Newmans/Benton draft (Which might *actually* be the George MacDonald-Fraser draft. Fraser was hired around the time Brando signed, July 1976 was when Brando signed. Thoughts?), and the Mankiewicz drafts are available.

The scripts that are not available are: The Norman Enfield draft, the Pre-Leslie Newman/Benton drafts, the Fraser drafts if the July one is not his work, and the 500 page monolith Donner was given (Likely a Non-Fraser Newman/Benton draft)

Well in the same Library where I found the Puzo scripts for the first time, I also found a strange draft with no title page. It's in a similar folder to the Puzo scripts, but has no identifiers. It only covers through Superman 1, and even then, seems to be missing a few pages at the end of it. It's 200 pages, for Superman 1 at that, which makes me consider this might be the first half of the \~500 page monolith Donner was given.

It seems to be Newman/Benton-derived, featuring their structure and campiness in the script. However, it's either expanded a lot, or has a lot that was then cut out. The two theories I have regarding it are:

1. It's a Pre-Fraser Newman/Benton draft, possibly even Pre-Leslie. Fraser cut down a longer Newman/Benton draft, so this being so long probably precludes it from being his. I say Leslie might not have been involved because Benton is NOT credited on Superman 2, and this script does only cover 1. If Benton left before they ever got around to writing 2, that might explain why Leslie is only credited on 2, and this could be a Pre-Leslie draft.
2. It's a heavily expanded script made Post-Fraser, to be verbose as possible for shooting, and is the monolith Donner got in late 1976.

Regardless, I'm trying to reach out to any community that might know about this script to see if anyone can identify it. Also any information on the unavailable scripts in general would be appreciated.

You can find the unidentified script [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J6sJAqRzvbNxFQK3TyQZ752zcoUklseV?usp=share_link)."

1. Jason Momoa was dropping those Lobo hints for no reason

2. Aquaman dies in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom

3. Jason Momoa will play Lobo in Ta Nehisi Coates' black Superman project, which is Elseworlds, so he wouldn't technically be playing two roles in the DCU at once"

DC_Cinematic,OPINION: The Joker shouldn't be used in any Batman movie for at least a Decade.,"I honestly feel that the Joker as a character has become way too Overused and Oversaturated in media to the point where he has lost all his impact and gravitas as a character because of how much they decide to use him.  

It's devolved into a pissing contest between actors trying to Out-Crazy the last and its just getting insufferable at this point, not every batman universe story or batman film trilogy needs a Joker. He's unnecessarily overused even in other mediums besides film, they managed to cram him into Injustice 2 despite him being dead In-Universe, i found that extremely unnecessary. I understand that the character is popular but to me he just feels like a Meme at this point, i enjoyed Matt Reeves Batman but the Joker Deleted scene felt so cringe to watch, we can have an effective and emotional Batman trilogy without this one specific villain to always circle back to. 

One of the many reasons Heath Ledger's Joker was so Amazing and Breathtaking was also the fact that we hadn't gotten a Big Screen Joker since 1989, and the wait built up a lot of anticipation for his portrayal.

I strongly feel now is the time to give the underutilized villain's a shot to be a threat in the films like Hush, Hugo Strange, Prometheus etc, as well as reimagine the poorly executed ones such as Mr Freeze and Victor Zassz."

DC_Cinematic,DCEU Watch Through #4 - Wonder Woman,"Alright this was one I was pretty excited to see, I‚Äôve heard a lot of good things about it over the years but this was my first time sitting down to watch it.

Let‚Äôs start with positives: Overall, I thought this was a well done origin story! The time on Themyscrira and seeing Diana grow up was fun. The politics there were a little confusing, and maybe more could have been done with the decision on what to do with Steve and with the new information of The Great War. We hear Diana‚Äôs perspective that the Amazons ultimate purpose was to protect/save mankind and defeat Ares. But this is shot down pretty quick by Hyppolyta, who was taking a much more conservative approach of just protecting Themerscyra and the Amazons.
Writing this helped me remember the last thing Hyppolyta said to Diana about being greatest love and greatest sorrow - which is pretty cool considering the ending being love is WW‚Äôs ultimate resolve for humankind.

Diana‚Äôs introduction to Britain and mankind was just awkward, funny, and great. They did a pretty good job, and we even get an ice cream scene.

Overall I thought they film was shot and directed well. There were just some beautiful shots throughout.
They ‚ÄúNo Man‚Äôs land‚Äù fight scene was just dope. Although I felt like there was a missed opportunity for WW to say ‚ÄúI am no man‚Äù before going to kick some ass.

Lupin as Sir Patrick was a great performance. Although it felt a little clunky when he went full Ares. Like I kinda wished they just used Lupin as Sir Patrick to show the many forms that Ares could take as a god, and a different actor took over the full Ares armor mode.

The reveal of Diana as a full blown GOD was pretty crazy to me. I thought maybe the reveal would be she was Ares child or something.

Ok now the cons:
For a film that the main characters entire arc was to result in love above all else being the thing to believe, the love story between Diana and Steve was pretty lackluster. They had some pretty good moments and decent repoire, but they did not sell me on being an amazing love story.

I guess for me, the 3rd and 4th acts were not as strong as the first half of the film.

I wish they did SO much more with Dr. Poison. Instead we got an insecure/loyal scientists. She could‚Äôve been the dubious and cunning mad scientist with a full stance on killing as many people as possible with her work.

I liked Diana‚Äôs conclusion that it wasn‚Äôt just the Germans corrupted by war, but the Americans and all mankind as well. But I thought it could‚Äôve been done with some blatant moves by Americans to stop WW or to stop the peace treaty, or some messed up scenes of American/British soldiers doing terrible things to citizens.

The final battle with Ares just didn‚Äôt do it for me. The use of CGI wasn‚Äôt as strong as it could‚Äôve been I guess? It‚Äôs interesting I enjoyed the smaller battles throughout though.

DC_Cinematic,Who do you think Ben Affleck would cast as Batman?,"I'm probably gonna regret making this post, but it's an interesting question to ask nonetheless. In the scenario where Affleck does direct Brave and the Bold, who do you think he'd get to play Batman? Looking at his filmography there seems to be a certain type of actors he likes to work with: Bryan Cranston, Jon Hamm, Scoot McNairy, John Goodman, Jeremy Renner, Zoe Saldana, Brendan Gleeson, etc.  


They're all people that are not necessarily super big,  but that tend to be recognizable to some significant degree, and have been in the movie business for a while, and generally if it's people from TV then it's really prestige TV (Jon Hamm, Bryan Cranston)  
With that in mind, and with everything we know about the movie (Based on Morrison's run, Damian will be introduced to him, it's gonna introduce more of the Bat-Family with probably at least Nightwing in the mix. In some capacity it's gonna have to heavily contrast with Pattinson) who do you think he'd get?  


[I stand by my previous casting pick.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/10vkbwi/lee_pace_should_be_dcus_batman/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I think he'd make sense for Affleck as a director as well."

DC_Cinematic,Concerns About DCU Slate,"I think a vast majority of these are going to be great, the only things revealed I actually think I'll dislike is Paradise Lost and Lanterns, but I do have concerns for the slate and the DCU as a whole:

1: Live action actors voicing their characters in animation might not work well since those are two different skill sets, I've seen this done terribly too many times.

2: Why is half of the slate being made by James Gunn? Like, don't get me wrong, I think he's great for the stuff he's making but Gunn is really good with obscure characters and giving them more spotlight and even improving them in some cases. The problem is I feel like it isn't good to start with this many obscure characters getting the spotlight this early.

3: I want to trust Gunn with Superman he seems to understand Superman based purely the picture he chose for Legacy but I haven't see a Gunn film with the tone I think would work best for Superman

4: I love Wildstorm but I can't really see Wildstorm characters in the DC Universe working all that well, especially the Authority which had an entire Superman issue made in response to it showing why The Authority doesn't really work well in the same world as Superman.

5: The Amazons are all about cooperation, Game of Thrones is fueled by its conflict. I can't see a Game of Thrones inspired story with the Amazons being good due to the amount of random dumb conflicts that would be thrown in.

6: I can't be the only one that heard the Paradise Lost idea and thought of Gotham and Krypton.

7: Please give us the OG Dan Jurgens style Booster Gold, that one is way better than the Geoff Johns version.

8: I don't hate Damian as much I used to but I feel like having him as our starter Robin skips out on some really good story possibilities. I feel it would've been better to start with Tim Drake as Robin. I can understand skipping Dick as Robin since a lot of his most important stories as Robin come from his time with the George Perez/Marv Wolfman Teen Titans and not really with Batman but Tim is different. Majority of Tim's important stories occurred when he was Robin by Batman's side like Knightfall, the Young Justice comics, his relationship with Stephanie, Cyborg's Teen Titans, Stephanie's death in War Games, and his father's death in Identity Crisis. Don't get me wrong, I love Tim as Red Robin, a genius who is always several steps ahead that can outthink his enemies but his time as Robin is so important to his character. That's not even mentioning that the Tim and Damian's rivalry was pretty important to introducing Damian to the audience. This all started with Damian wanting to take his rightful place at his father's side and deciding the best way to do that was to murder his competition, Tim Drake. You don't get that without building up Tim.

9: If we're adapting Morrison's run of Batman here, does that mean we'll eventually get to Dick becoming Batman? I mean, the artwork used for The Brave and the Bold comes from when Dick was Batman, the person in the Batsuit isn't Bruce. Like, how do we get from here to there? This is another reason I feel like starting at Damian is a bit of a mistake here.

10: Woman of Tomorrow is a really good story but I don't think it's a good way to introduce Kara into the universe. The story is more of a deconstruction of her character when I feel it needs to be built up first. I feel it would be better to focus more on how her character was in STAS. A girl that lost her home and has to get used to the new, lesser world around her, going to school, making friends, and training to prove she doesn't need her cousin to keep protecting her. Then have her prove herself as a strong hero in her own right.

11: A Green Lantern flavored True Detective sounds boring, why does Supergirl get the space faring adventure and Green Lantern's stuck in Earth? They should be out in space fighting space pirates with giant light constructs or something."

The main issue is that James Gunn wants the DC games to be connected with the live action, which would make this idea less likely.

These pics below are from a game that was announced in 2012. With the advanced technology we now have in game design, the possibilities are insane. Dafoe's Joker in the game would look about the same as he would in real life.

**About the Films:**

***Superman: The Movie***

Academy  Award winners Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman head an all-star cast in  the fantastic, action-packed film that made Christopher Reeve an  international star  playing the greatest superhero of all time.¬† From the doomed planet of  Krypton, two parents launch a spaceship carrying their infant son to  earth.¬† Here he grows up to become Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter  for the Metropolis Daily Planet.¬† But with powers  and abilities far beyond those of ordinary men, he battles for truth  and justice as Superman.

An Alexander Salkind presentation and directed by Richard Donner (*The Goonies, Lethal Weapon, The Lost Boys)*, the film stars Academy Award  winner Marlon Brando (*On the Waterfront*, *The Godfather)* as Jor-El, Academy Award winner Gene Hackman (*The French Connection*, *Unforgiven*) as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman.

Based on the DC character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, ***Superman*** was produced by Pierre Spengler from a story by  Mario Puzo and a screenplay by Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, and  Robert Benton.¬† Ilya Salkind served as executive producer.¬† The film  also features Ned Beatty as Otis, Jackie Cooper  as Perry White, Glen Ford as Jonathan Kent, Margot Kidder as Lois Lane,  Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher, and Terrance Stamp as General Zod.

***Superman*** was  nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Film Editing, Best  Music (Original Score) and Best Sound.¬† The film also received a Special  Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects.¬†  In 2017, ***Superman*** was inducted into the Library of Congress National Film Registry.

**SYNOPSIS**

***Superman II*** **(Theatrical Version)**

Unwittingly  released from Phantom Zone imprisonment, three superpowered Planet  Krypton criminals Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) plan  to enslave Earth ‚Äì just  when Superman (Christopher Reeve) decides to show a more romantic side  to Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Gene Hackman also returns as Lex Luthor in  this sequel that features a top supporting cast, witty Richard Lester  direction, and visuals that astound and delight.

Directed by Richard Lester (*A Hard Day‚Äôs Night, The Three Musketeers)*, the film stars Academy Award winner Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Margot  Kidder as Lois Lane, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman.

Based  on the DC character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the film  was produced by Pierre Spengler from a story by Mario Puzo and a  screenplay by Puzo,  David Newman, and Leslie Newman.¬† Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind  served as executive producer.¬† The film also features Ned Beatty as  Otis, Jackie Cooper as Perry White, Sarah Douglas as Ursa, Jack  O‚ÄôHalloran as Non, Valerie Perrine as Eve Teschmacher,  Susannah York as Lara, and Terrence Stamp as General Zod.

***Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut***

Director Richard Donner began shooting *Superman II* while concurrently filming *Superman: The Movie*,  though the theatrical version of the film was ultimately directed by  Richard Lester. In 2006, Donner‚Äôs original unique vision was released  for the first time. Jor-El (Marlon Brando in  footage cut from the theatrical version) appears in key scenes that  amplify Superman lore and deepen the relationship between father and  son. Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) plots more schemes to unmask Clark Kent  as Superman (Christopher Reeve). With so many changes,  large and small, including a different beginning and resolution, this  version is an eye-opening alternate experience.

Directed  by Richard Donner, the film stars Academy Award winner Marlon Brando as  Jor-El, Academy Award winner Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder  as Lois Lane, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman.

Based on the DC character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the film was produced by Pierre Spengler and Michael Tau from a story by  Mario Puzo and a screenplay by Puzo, David Newman, and Leslie Newman.¬†  Ilya Salkind served as executive producer.¬† The film also features Ned  Beatty as Otis, Jackie Cooper as Perry White,  Sarah Douglas as Ursa, Jack O‚ÄôHalloran as Non, Valerie Perrine as Eve  Teschmacher, Susannah York as Lara, and Terrence Stamp as General Zod.

***Superman III***

Meet  Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), a naive computer-programming natural. For  him, a keyboard is a weapon ‚Äì and, as a result, Superman faces the  microelectronic menace of his life. Christopher  Reeve reprises his signature role, deepening his character‚Äôs human side  as Clark Kent sees Lana Lang (Annette O‚ÄôToole) at a Smallville High  class reunion. And when the Man of Steel becomes his own worst enemy  after exposure to Kryptonite, Reeve pulls off both  roles with dazzling skill. Relive *Superman III* with all its heart, heroism and high-flying humor. 

Directed by Richard Lester, the film stars Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman and Margot Kidder as Lois Lane.

Based  on the DC character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the film  was produced by Pierre Spengler from a screenplay by David Newman and  Leslie Newman.¬†  Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind served as executive producer.¬† The  film also features Richard Pryor as Gus Gorman, Jackie White as Perry  White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Annette O‚ÄôToole as Lana Lang, and  Robert Vaughn as Ross Webster.

***Superman IV: The Quest for Peace***

Christopher  Reeve not only dons the title hero‚Äôs cape for the fourth time but also  helped develop the movie‚Äôs provocative theme: nuclear disarmament. To  make the world safe for nuclear arms  merchants, Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) creates a new being to challenge  the Man of Steel: the radiation-charged Nuclear Man (Mark Pillow). The  two foes clash in an explosive extravaganza that sees Superman save the  Statue of Liberty, plug the volcanic eruption  of Mount Etna and rebuild the demolished Great Wall of China. 

Directed by Sydney J. Furie (*The Ipcress File, Iron Eagle)*, the film stars Academy Award winner Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor, Margot Kidder as  Lois Lane, and Christopher Reeve as Clark Kent/Superman.

Based on the DC character created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the film was produced by Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan from a story by  Christopher Reeve &amp; Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal and a  screenplay by Konner &amp; Rosenthal.¬† The film also features Jackie  Cooper as Perry White, Marc McClure as Jimmy Olsen, Jon Cryer  as Lenny, Sam Wanamaker as David Warfield, Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man,  and Mariel Hemingway as Lacy Warfield.

DC_Cinematic,"In the wake of The Batman, what should or could The Brave and the Bold do to their DCU Batman...","...that clearly shows this is not Matt Reeves' version, as well as have in their DCU Batman that Reeves' Bat-Verse can't have and vice versa? 

I think their Bruce Wayne is easy to figure out, being more of the handsome playboy, and having a son as Robin is another big difference, connected to a larger Bat Family. But what about villains, will we see the Black Glove from Morrison's run, and are all unshareable like Joker? How can Gotham look here compared to the Bat-Verse? Same goes for the Batmobile, Batcave, the suits, and so on. 

While we only know Grant Morrison's run will be the inspiration, and Damian Wayne's Robin will be in it, we don't know much or perhaps none at all. And with the Elseworlds Bat-Verse in full swing, it's why I'm asking this what if discussion."

DC_Cinematic,The Snyderverse did not portray Superman or Batman faithfully to the comics,"In the comics and animated series, Superman is incredibly careful about collateral damage. He does everything possible to avoid casualties in the midst of all the carnage. But in Man of Steel, he constantly throws Zod into buildings which obviously have people in them, despite knowing that'll do little to even injure him. He destroys an entire city and shows little restraint. Not only that, he doesn't even apologize for it at any point. Superman is supposed to be about hope, yet he avoidably ended the hopes and dreams of many lives in that battle. He could've easily led Zod away into a more isolated area and kept the fight near his home, but of course that doesn't look as cool in Snyder's world, so he doesn't even try. Also, Superman's media is always uplifting, light-hearted and colorful, yet Snyder turned him into a dark, brooding, gritty take in an attempt to ripoff the Dark Knight trilogy.

And where do I start with his Batman? Holy shit. He's the world's worst detective. He attacks and tries to kill Superman based on very flimsy evidence, without even conducting an investigation. Specifically, he blames him for blowing up the courthouse and killing all those people (even though they died from a bombing...) and doesn't even attempt to investigate the crime scene or look at any evidence. Instead, he takes the whole thing at face value and takes the most drastic action possible. As someone who's (1) the world's greatest detective and (2) never kills people unless it's a last resort, **this is literally the opposite of Batman.**

I'll just say it. Zack Snyder doesn't understand Superman or Batman and never did. He doesn't understand the Justice League and doesn't understand DC comics. And it's not just Bats or Supes he got wrong...Lex Luthor was hilariously off the mark, just like everyone predicted. Aquaman is a sarcastic dimwit who acts/looks nothing like the smart, serious Arthur Curry from the comics. Darkseid was nerfed unbelievably, getting his arm cut off and defeated in his only scene, despite being one of the most powerful beings in DC. And please don't get me started on how he butchered Doomsday.

I'm so glad the Snyderverse is dead. I can't wait for DC to be handled by good filmmakers who understand and respect the source material for a change."

DC_Cinematic,"For the first time in my life, I want DC to fail","I'm a huge DC fan. I have been since I was a kid. And I have seen every single DCEU movie and theaters, I've also bought every single one of them on Blu-ray. I tried to support them, I was hoping that this universe would turn around. But eventually I realized that it's just not, and now I am 100% behind a full reboot.

Because of this I choose not to support three out of the four DC movies coming out this year. The only one I'm going to see (at least pay to see) is Blue Beetle. This is because I believe that David Zazalv is motivated by one thing and one thing only, and that's money. I fear that if the upcoming DCEU movies, Aquaman, The Flash, Shazam, do well he will force them into the new DCU to come. And I feel that's a huge mistake.

The DCEU is a failure. And adding this baggage to a fresh universe will just drag it down. Gun also avoiding giving a straight answer on whether or not he's moving forward with those actors in those roles is also disheartening. I know everyone is saying ""He just can't say that they're out because it'll affect the box office"" But really I feel like it's the other way around, he won't say they're out because he's waiting to see about the box office. 

So long story short, this is the first time I actively won't see DC movies in theaters, and I'm hoping that they'll disappoint at the box office so we can just close this 10-year chapter that is the DCEU."

Hear me out. So I absolutely loved Snyder‚Äôs DC films and I thought the Snyder cut of Justice League is way superior than the atrocious unwatchable Josstice League and back then I would‚Äôve loved the Snyderverse to continue. However, the more I think about it and after I read what Zack Snyder‚Äôs plans were for the Justice League sequels, I‚Äôm pretty much glad we‚Äôre not getting the continuation because from the knightmare sequence ending in ZSJL, you see Superman is evil and he killed Diana and Arthur and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good way to represent Superman like that or to even make it too dark than it already is. It also wouldn‚Äôt feel like proper Justice League films especially with the heroes teaming with villains. I‚Äôm also not a fan of what I read about Bruce Wayne and Lois Lane being in a relationship like wtf?! I love Snyder but I‚Äôm more looking forward to what Gunn and Safran will do with their Justice League reboot and make it right this time around while respecting the characters and not completely changing them from who they are. I want a JL film where Superman is the leader he‚Äôs destined to be and where he‚Äôs good, not when he‚Äôs a killer. It was a great privilege to say all this while pissing off some toxic Snyder fans who just can‚Äôt move on."

I feel like the suit should be more lighter blue and red to really make the colors pop out more without being over saturated and also to symbolize hope unlike MOS where the suit was too dark blue. I‚Äôm honestly really excited for this film because we haven‚Äôt had a Superman solo film in a long time and while it sucks Henry Cavill won‚Äôt be returning, I‚Äôm just glad we‚Äôre getting a new Superman film that looks like it‚Äôll be the first true hopeful Superman film since 1978.

DC_Cinematic,They should continue the Snyderverse with a comic series,"Zack Snyders ideas and plans for the future films left many divided on its direction. I personally think the Snyder films are actually not as bad as people make them out to be, they feel too much like a elseworlds tale of a universe we haven't seen enough of. I think that if they gave them the green light to continue the story through a comic medium it might actually work better than whatever the sell it to netflix thing that is going on. Not only could they continue the other Justice League stories in comics they could also adapt the planned Batfleck movie into a comic.

Or will they explain they are still living in their old universe. I dunno it just seems a kind of dark ending for characters to be erased from existence."

DC_Cinematic,Just finished Batman Returns.,"We desperately need a new visual aesthetic in DC movies (I saw DC as they have a history of far better visuals than Marvel movies). Burton's huge, gothic epics are such a good time. Equal parts goofy charm, and horror-tinged gothic noir. 

The lighting, the costumes, and the set design all built such a phenomenal, idiosyncratic Gotham City. It felt lived in, but also kinda otherworldly? 

I'd love to see a return to varying visuals. Get filmmakers that have a distinct look. It can all be the same universe, but just let them look different, at the very least. I'm exhausted by the Marvel bland realism with its techy polish. Incredibly uncinematic."

DC_Cinematic,Asked Chatgpt to create a horror batman movie with scarecrow as the main villian would you watch this,"&amp;#x200B;

Title: Batman: Nightmares Unleashed   
Plot:   
Gotham City is under attack by a new terror as Scarecrow unleashes a potent fear toxin on the citizens. The toxin causes people to see their worst nightmares come to life, and chaos ensues as they try to escape from their own fears. Batman (played by Ben Affleck) must confront Scarecrow (played by Willem Dafoe) and put an end to his madness before Gotham is destroyed.   
As Batman investigates the source of the toxin, he discovers that Scarecrow has teamed up with the Joker (played by Joaquin Phoenix), who is back from the dead and more dangerous than ever. Together, they plan to drive the citizens of Gotham into a permanent state of fear and take over the city.   
Batman enlists the help of his closest allies, including Robin (played by Timothee Chalamet) and Batgirl (played by Zendaya), to take down the villains. However, their task is made more difficult as they are also haunted by their own fears, thanks to the toxin.   
As the battle between good and evil rages on, the line between reality and nightmare becomes increasingly blurred. Batman and his team must overcome their own fears to save the city and defeat Scarecrow and Joker before it's too late.   
Cast:   
‚Ä¢ Batman: Ben Affleck   
‚Ä¢ Scarecrow: Willem Dafoe   
‚Ä¢ Joker: Joaquin Phoenix   
‚Ä¢ Robin: Timothee Chalamet   
‚Ä¢ Batgirl: Zendaya   
‚Ä¢ Alfred: Jeremy Irons   
‚Ä¢ Commissioner Gordon: Jeffrey Wright   
‚Ä¢ Harvey Dent/Two-Face: Aaron Eckhart (appearing in flashbacks as part of Batman's nightmare)   
‚Ä¢ Poison Ivy: Margot Robbie (appearing in Batman's hallucination)   
The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan, who brings his trademark dark and brooding style to the world of Batman. The film is rated R for violence, gore, and disturbing imagery, and is not recommended for young children or those who are easily frightened"

DC_Cinematic,BSL: Shazam: Fury of the Gods Test Screenings: I‚Äôve been hearing consistently good things for the last year and a half or so. One person even told me they prefer it to the original.,-

DC_Cinematic,"Despite being the butt of many fan-casting jokes, who would you genuinely want Tom Holland to play in the DCU?",-
DC_Cinematic,Would you want to see Mark Strong reprise his role as a new Sinestro in the DCU?,"Very few actors can truly embody their roles and characters in film, and for all the negativity surrounding the Green Lantern movie, Mark Strong's portrayal of Sinestro was absolutely perfect. I would like to see him back in whatever GL property the new DCU is crafting, without having to acknowledge the past film.

If JK Simmons can come back as J Jonah Jameson for the MCU, I would love to see Mark Strong come back as Sinestro for the DCU.

Or we cast him as Brainiac?"

I suppose the actor should be around the age of 35 or so. Personally I have no suggestions. :D
DC_Cinematic,We don't need TWO Batmen on the DCU: We NEED a funny man and good husband Green Arrow on the DCU!,"Let me explain:

I know think that everyone in here know VERY WELL who is the Green Arrow from the CW-DC's-Universe

And... He's not a bad character, but he is a LITERALLY a adaptation of the character of Batman because Warner can't create a serie of Batman without Fox/Disney on his series.

We don't need this patch on the new DCEU, James Gunn already spoke about him on the Peacemaker series, and we don't need TWO Batmen on the new DCU, i think (and wish) that he use the original Green Arrow on the DCU, you know? The Blonde funny guy with some arrows and a hot wife that can kill you literally only screaming."

DC_Cinematic,What would you think of Daniel Diemer (The Half of it) as Clark Kent?,"He doesn‚Äôt have the traditional Superman look but I think he could really age into the role. He gives the feeling of a farm boy, too optimistic for his own good. He is currently 25, meaning he is at just the right age for what Gunn is looking for. He is also a very new actor so he will get to fully embody the character. Thoughts?

DC_Cinematic,The Ayer Assembly (fan edit),"I spent a few months tracking down all the various leaks and cut content of David Ayer's Suicide Squad. It's not perfect and I've got no editing experience to speak of, but I think it's the best approximation of the original film we can get right now. The only piece I added was the Flash cameo, which I moved to a different spot and added music from the Snyder Cut. PM me for a download link."
DC_Cinematic,Favorite (Canon or Fanon) Romantic Couple?,"Since I don‚Äôt read many comics, my choices are pretty basic. They are not ranked. 

1. RobStar (Robin x Starfire)

I really enjoyed their relationship in the Teen Titans show and the DCAMU. They are really cute and their dynamic works. 

2. BBRae(Beast Boy x Raven)

Their different personalities and nice moments they had in Teen Titans made me really want them to be a couple. I‚Äôve also read many fanfics that showed the potential they had in being a couple. 

3. DinahOllie(Black Canary x Green Arrow)

I find them really cute in JLU and Injustice 2. They match so well and I hope their relationship gets more spotlight. 

4. DickBabs

Although I don‚Äôt love this ship as much as RobStar, but I still think this ship is very cute. I liked them in Young Justice.

5. Questress(Question x Huntress)

Really liked their moments in JLU. My favorite was them working together and when Question revealed his face to her since that was an important secret. 

6. HawkLantern(Green Lantern x Hawkgirl)
I liked their growth to becoming a couple throughout most of Justice League and was sad that it didn‚Äôt work out. At least it‚Äôs hinted that they might get back together. 

7. DamiRae(Damian Wayne x Raven) 
Damian and Raven‚Äôs relationship was one of my favorite parts about the DCAMU. It was hard to get used to at first since I‚Äôm used to Raven being the same age as Dick and Starfire, but I got used to it after seeing how much they work. Raven and Damian were raised to not express emotions and had a terrible parent that caused trauma. Their moments in JLD: Apokolips War made me really like them. 

8. TimKon(Tim Drake x Kon-El/Superboy)
Fanfics and fanart made me really like them. The fans talked about their dynamic in the comic and that made me enjoy their relationship(platonic or not) and 

9. Spitfire(Kid Flash x Artemis)
Kid Flash and Artemis were my favorite Young Justice couple. Their development from rivals to friends to lovers was done so well and they built each other up really well. 

10. SuperMartian(Miss Martian x Superboy)
Miss Martian and Superboy are my second favorite YJ couple. Season 1 had really sweet moments between them like Superboy supporting M‚Äôgann when she revealed her true form and M‚Äôgann saving Superboy when he was driven insane by Simon. Season 2 soured my opinion on the ship because of what M‚Äôgann did to Superboy, but their wedding in Season 4 made me love them again."
DC_Cinematic,Justice League vs. The Flash fractures,"I am looking forward to the movie The Flash. One detail I am looking for is why the reversal of time and changing of the outcome of the Mother Box Unity didn't cause ripples or fractures in the timeline, but Barry going back and saving his Mom does. The Unity seems like such a larger event that should have larger fractures. Perhaps the length of time between the initial occurrence and the time travel is what  causes the fracture, not the importance of the event? The time travel in JL occurred almost immediately after the event (small fracture), whereas his Mom was murdered 15-20 years ago (big fracture). Any thoughts?"
DC_Cinematic,The Batman-Riddler,"Might be an unpopular opinion. Rewatching The Batman again this evening on HBO. The riddler dialogue and delivery of said dialogue is very cringe. I did like the storyline, that dude who plays riddler I actually laughed out loud because it was so fucking goofy. But that‚Äôs just me. What you think?"
DC_Cinematic,I've heard a lot of people say they don't want the DCU to delve into multiverse stories? My question is... why?,"DC is the godfather of multiverse stories in pop culture. The elseworlds and Crisis stories are DC's most iconic storylines. It'd be a damn shame if they weren't adapted to the big screen.

The actual mistake would be to introduce multiverse stories very early on. I'd say Chapter 3 would be a good start."

But knowing that if Warner Bros didn't incredibly mess up the DCEU, we could have had a really cool story with what this game is presenting. Maybe we also could have had a really cool Superman movie with Brainiac as the villain, but oh well no point in dwelling on what could have been. Here's to hoping James Gunn's DCU will lead us to excitement."

That‚Äôs the one thing Henry‚Äôs Superman didn‚Äôt get to do. Seeing these characters conflicted with being a hero and trying to live normal lives and what not. Something more real. You got all these kids that go to school that can turn into gods and plot is old lady witches want to destroy shit and we gotta stop them.

* 1994: Bruce Wayne is born.
* 1998: Kal-El is born on a dying planet and sent to Earth. Simultaneously, Kara‚Äôs father uses a forcefield to rescue the city of Argo from the destruction.
* 2000: Citizens of the Argo colony start to die off from radiation poisoning originating from Krypton‚Äôs destruction. By 2000, the entire Argo colony has died off despite Kara‚Äôs best efforts. Zor-El sends his 14-year old daughter to Earth, like his brother had done to his own child, to ensure her survival. Upon reaching Earth, the Kara begins years of hibernation
* 2002: Bruce Wayne loses his parents at age 8.
* 2006: Dick Grayson is born
* 2009: Jason Todd is born. That same year, Bruce leaves Gotham at age 15 to study abroad.
* 2012: Tim Drake is born
* 2014: Bruce joins the League of Assassins at age 20. During his time there, he romances the Daughter of the Demon, Talia Al Ghul.
* 2016: 
   * Bruce Wayne leaves the League of Assassins and returns to Gotham at age 22, becoming Batman. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had fathered a child with Talia during his time there.
* 2019: 
   * 21-year-old Clark Kent becomes Superman after moving to Metropolis.
   * Later that year, Dick Grayson loses his parents at age 13 during a sabotaged circus performance. 7-year-old Tim Drake is in attendance and witnesses Dick Grayson‚Äôs signature quadruple flip, a feat only a few people in the world can accomplish
* 2020: 
   * Superman forms the Justice League at age 22. Later that year, he discovers his cousin, Kara Zor-El. Kara is chronologically much older but physically 14 thanks to years of hibernation.
   * Superman is hospitalised following an encounter with Bloodsport. Bloodsport is subsequently captured by Kal-El‚Äôs cousin, Supergirl, while Superman is in the ICU.
* 2021: The events of *The Suicide Squad*
* 2022: 
   * The events of *Peacemaker* \- the Justice League is called in to deal with a disturbance. Upon arriving, Superman, Batman, Aquaman, and the Flash discover that the situation has been dealt with by the Eleventh Street Kids.
   * That same year, Tim Drake, now 10, watches footage of Batman and Robin in action and sees that Robin is capable of doing a quadruple flip just like Dick Grayson. He later makes the connection that if Dick Grayson is Robin, then his adoptive father, Bruce Wayne must be the Batman.
* 2023: 
   * Dick Grayson graduates from the mantle Robin at age 17. He is inspired to take the name ‚ÄúNightwing‚Äù following a meeting with Superman, age 25. Jason Todd becomes Robin later that year at age 14.

   * Jason Todd is killed by the Joker at age 15.
   * The events of *Waller*
* 2025:

DC_Cinematic,My 4 predictions for the antagonist (s) in The Brave &amp; The Bold,"1.- Clayface : Honestly this is my major prediction which I am 100% sure will appear either as main antagonist or secondary but he will be there, I really think Gunn will want to use the more fantastical and unused villains from batman‚Äôs mythos and without saying Clayface checks that boxes. Aside from that he is a character that can be really maximized being played by different actors as well being cgi with its own voice actor which Gunn is famous for using cgi characters with popular actor as their voices,  he could really bent into a supernatural detective story which I think the story will have elements of and finally he is almost unkillable which with Damian being Robin this could also maximize the use of his assasins skills pretty well. Bonus points clayface played James Gunn in the Harley Show

2.- Madhatter : Fantastical in its own right and with a very creepy but also comical motif that goes right in Gunns creative alley, now his main thing is mind control imagine him mind controlling batman into fighting his own son or vice versa 

3.- Poison Ivy : Giving the same mind contolling argument but come on she is a whole city / world threat level villain, could imagine her creating her own plant soldiers and Damian killing them in very gory ways also with Swamp Thing being pivotal to the overall phase as Gunn stated , poison ivy has connection to the green as well meaning this movie  be the nexus between Swamp Thing into the DC.

4.- The Ventriloquist : Definitely not major by any means but could just be like the first villain the dou easily defeat could see Damian making sarcastic remarks of ‚Äúhow ridiculous his father‚Äôs enemies are‚Äù also as stated before his whole motif is in Gunn‚Äôs alley"

DC_Cinematic,DCEU Watch Through #3 - Suicide Squad,"Oh boy, this was one from the watch through that I was kind of dreading, but made it through so here we go!

Let‚Äôs start with the positives. 

All in all, I really do like Margot Robbie‚Äôs Harley Quinn. She‚Äôs funny, plays Harley‚Äôs lunacy quite well, and is almost happy go lucky throughout the film. They also make her useful in fight scenes and throughout the movie. Something I noticed in the animated film, Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay - she was really quite useless throughout.

Even though she‚Äôs a super side character, Katana looked awesome on screen. While they mostly kept mysterious, they explained her situation quite well with like two lines of dialogue.

I liked enchantress‚Äôs design before she went rogue. Very cool the way they showed her taking over June‚Äôs body when summoned.

The fight scenes weren‚Äôt terrible and were visually appealing as times.

Ok so for the rest of the movie. What went wrong? Or better put, what didn‚Äôt go wrong?

I‚Äôve seen people on here make fun of the soundtrack. But in all seriousness it‚Äôs like half the movie is a playlist of pop rock hits through the years and the rest of it is just‚Ä¶ nothing? Every character intro in the beginning does not need a separate song. It really takes away from the viewing of the movie in general. Maybe if they left that to just the trailers, chose two songs one for the intro and one for the outro.
Are there movies that use a lot of songs in their soundtrack and it works well?

Enchantress I kind of wish they didn‚Äôt make Enchantress under Wallers control from the get go. It‚Äôs just like Wallers whole argument is that something terrible could happen and she‚Äôs needed Suicide Squad to fight it - but the entire conflict the movie is based upon is entirely her fault for fucking with shit she doesn‚Äôt understand. I get Waller does messed up stuff and this fits her MO - but I feel a little separation from the villain would have been nice. Like what if she pitched her Suicide Squad, they got at least one mission under their belt. Then architects + June randomly stumbled upon Enchantress setting her free upon the world. And if it really needed to be Wallers fault than the exposition was Waller sending people to find meta humans etc.
Waller was just prancing enchantress around like a party trick, a being she knew had crazy/dark and potent powers.

Also I really would have liked some character building of Enchantress and her brother Incubus.

I wish they gave Slipnot a chance! Dead on his first walk climb.

Killer Croc. Everything about this rendition of the character just felt wrong. Every line cringe. His design terrible.

Out of all the Joker stuff there is one scene of him interrogating some gambler, Grimm I think? And it was super creepy and played really well. This just tells me that there was at least a little potential with Letos Joker. I kind of wished they played into the abusive aspects of his and Harleys relationship - but instead the whole plot line played like we were supposed to be rooting for their love story. The one scene (maybe two) where they showed his abusiveness was when he left her in the car to drown with Batman there to save her. And pushing her into the vat of acid, but they 180‚Äôd this by have Joker run and dive in to save her. That really doesn‚Äôt feel like a Joker thing to do. It was kinda interesting though, Joker was on this warpath to find and free Harley. Finds and rescues her, deactivates the bomb in her head and all. And then when the helicopter got shot down and Harley got separated, she didn‚Äôt even go look for him and just gave up on him to return back to the suicide squad, even with the bomb deactivated. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong her and offscreen/it was implied she looked for him. But it‚Äôs like the next scene she is just sitting on a cop car waiting for the squad.

The worst Joker scene for me is the room where he is surrounded by computers, guns and knives.

Deadshot. It‚Äôs interesting, the first time I saw this movie, he was my favorite protagonist that I rooted for the most. But this second watch through, he‚Äôs a bit more disjointed than before. Constantly antagonizing all the guards around him. His shooting scenes weren‚Äôt the very bad ass. But what really threw me for a loop was Enchantress showing everyone their deepest desires and Deadshots being to kill Batman. And this was after he loudly announced all he wanted was for his daughter not to think he was a scumbag. Just felt like missed opportunity to show himself happily living with his daughter in a healthy way.

Captain Boomerang was okay? Just a little lackluster, but I think that my just be his character lol

Oh and a criticism I‚Äôve seen elsewhere but still think applies: they try to make the Suicide Squad look like heroes. Not villains, not antiheroes, but heroes. And this just kind of takes away from the fun and excitement that could‚Äôve been.

What were some of your takes? What did you like the most? Hate the most? Anything you think I‚Äôm totally off the mark on?"

DC_Cinematic,One thing I would've liked to see from Snyder's JL arc: the Future World's Finest,"We all know Zack Snyder's plans for the Justice League sequels, his Superman arc, but I'm gonna have to tell it to explain my point. 

Basically, the Knightmare future we saw in BvS and ZSJL is the result of Darkseid murdering Lois Lane, and Superman, corrupted by the Anti-Life Equation, rules Earth in the process. Batman and his team of heroes and villains send the Flash back long enough to send a warning to prevent this timeline from existing to Batman. Batman, with new knowledge from the Flash, then sacrifices his own life to save Lois from Darkseid, giving Superman just enough time to fight the tyrant back. They defeat Darkseid, and the Knightmare future is prevented. 

In an epilogue set years later, Superman and Lois' son, Bruce Jonathan Kent, named after the man who saved his life, doesn't have powers like his father. So he decides to become whom he is named after, and becomes the next Batman. Which means, the Future World's Finest is Superman, and his son, Batman!

This is something I kept thinking about since I heard about this. Not once, with the exception of John Bryne's Superman/Batman: Generations, has anyone thought of this. If it happened, it would've just been a cameo sure; but it would've been on the same what if page, along with John Blake's Batman post-TDKR. But imagine: Superman and Batman under a father/son dynamic. I like this idea, and amongst the rest of this story, I think we missed out seeing this. 

I know you guys will say otherwise, but this is just how I feel."

And since we are looking at a superman between 25-30 he's probably not old enough to have Jonathan Kent. Introducing Kara in the Superman movie would also give them a chance to contrast the differences between Kal and Kara before she gets her own movie which if its at all like the comic wouldn't be on earth or feature Kal.

DC_Cinematic,A My Dinner With Andre type of movie for DC,"I keep seeing these posts asking questions about why DC superheroes aren't supposed to kill and I think this type of a movie would be good fit explaining how and why we're supposed to be better than that. 

In my eyes, it would be cool to see a Lois Lane sitting down for dinner with Superman a while after he's made his presence known in Metropolis, and by extension, the world. 

As she's asking him questions about how he apprehended some obscure bad guy who raped and killed or whatever, and the scene cuts to the action, (because otherwise audiences would get bored). As Superman is holding this bad guy, the voice over of Superman says, ""and it took everything in me not to kill him there on the spot"", she asks him, ""why didn't you? You could've snapped his neck and justice would've been served""

Then the Superman actor will earn his paycheck within the next couple of scenes talking about how we as a society have to understand that people aren't born bad and we have to fix society because it's not enough to just put all the bad people on an island and blow them up. How essentially, we need to fix the underlying issues of mental health and such in order to bring about peace. Or something more eloquent lol

Also, it would be cool to see Superman defend Batman because we know batman isn't talking to the media, and we get cameos from him. 

""Why doesn't Batman just kill the joker?""
""It's not up to Batman to decide if the joker lives or dies. Batman is trying to save everyone, including the joker. "" 

Thanks for reading"
DC_Cinematic,Chris Pine &amp; Gary from team America,-
DC_Cinematic,My pitch for a DCU Chapter 1 that starts with a Cyborg movie,"1. Cyborg

A Cyborg solo movie that leans heavily into the cyberpunk and neo-noir / tech noir genres, establishing Cyborg as a technological force of nature and connecting him with everything in the DC universe. Lean deep into the hacking and do something unique with that. Have the main villain be Brainiac since Brainiac is also a technological beast of a character, and Cyborg has to use his technological toolset to try and overtake him. Superman is dead or captured by Brainiac, and it all falls on Cyborg, but he can sense that he's no match for Brainiac, and Brainiac wins in the end. A very dark movie that ends with Brainiac creating his own technocratic experiment (since the theme is tech noir)


2. Batman Beyond 

Have this lead to a second movie that kind of adapts the Future State comics, where it's now a dystopian experiment of a society but no one knows it's Brainiac's experiment yet. Lean into the philosophical question of ""Are we living in a simulation?"" 

Center it around Terry McGinnis and adapt the Neo-Year comic run. Lean deep into the futuristic neo-noir vibe.

Then, a third movie could be Cyborg waking up and evolving and gaining the strength to liberate everyone from Brainiac's control.


3. Static Shock

As a result of Brainiac's influence, there are new superhumans with tech related abilities. Static is one of them and has an intense connection with electricity. He's an anarchist and a rebel. This movie has an edgy ""rage against the machine"" vibe. Still workin on the details.

4. Prometheus 

A dark character study that takes some inspiration from Todd Phillips' Joker and dives deep into the backstory and origins of Prometheus - another technological villain with a battle computer embedded in his headpiece. 

5. Deathstroke Inc.

The introduction of Deathstroke as a savage and brazen contract killer. Karl Urban will play Deathstroke. This movie dives deep into private military corporations in the context of a futuristic and cyberpunk society. Deathstroke will be established as the John Wick of this DCU. No, he will not be a child predator. 

6. Ghost-Maker 

Since I've introduced a Deathstroke Inc. project, the next movie will dive into Batman Inc. and take some inspiration from the Batman incorporated comic run. Just like the Deathstroke Inc. project, this will also focus on futuristic private military corporations. It will specifically highlight Ghost-Maker's interesting journey to becoming the head of the Batman Incorporated organization. The whole Bat-Family will be introduced with an added cyberpunk aesthetic. This is where the Bat fam will be introduced and it will set up future spinoffs like a Red Hood and the Outlaws project.

7. Red Hood: Outlaw

A wild movie with a tone similar to James Gunn's The Suicide Squad. Static Shock is also a part of the Outlaws team with Red Hood and Arsenal being the leaders.


These are just brief outlines and sketches of ideas - still working on the details. I plan to make scripts for these eventually."

DC_Cinematic,Possible plot for DC Paradise Lost,"Would be interesting if the show was about hercules and the 9th labor.

https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Herakles/amazon.html

&gt; Queen Hippolyte had a special piece of armor. It was a leather belt that had been given to her by Ares, the war god, because she was the best warrior of all the Amazons. She wore this belt across her chest and used it to carry her sword and spear. Eurystheus wanted Hippolyte's belt as a present to give to his daughter, and he sent Hercules to bring it back. 

In this version the arrival of hercules, he doesn't kill Hippolyte but goes back to the city with her has her lover.

It then leads to intrigue and gods playing with pawns over who gets the belt.

Could be done in a non reliable narrator like 300.

So would the 9th labor be a good premise for the show?

DC_Cinematic,Theory: James Gunn and Peter Safran are intentionally sabotaging Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom,"Now this may sound absurd at first glance but I‚Äôm sure many of you will come to find this idea likely.

First off, several scoopers like [BigScreenLeaks](https://twitter.com/bigscreenleaks/status/1627743288332636160?s=20) and [ViewerAnon](https://twitter.com/ViewerAnon/status/1627748734913376257?s=20) have said that there have been test screenings for the film recently which were DISASTROUS and was so bad that some people walked out prematurely.

While in the past they said that[Aquaman 2‚Äôs test screening was ‚Äòmostly positive‚Äô](https://twitter.com/bigscreenleaks/status/1553498936794836992?s=20). That‚Äôs weird right?

However not too long after James Gunn and Peter Safran had become head of DC Stufios it was revealed that there were [reshoots](https://twitter.com/TheComixKid/status/1598105046838714368?s=20) for Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom (also confirmed by Jason Mamoa) which were significant which was also in between the last time we heard positive reception from screenings and when we heard negative reception.

Now why would James Gunn and Peter Safran try to sabotage the film? After all Safran was a producer on the film even before he was promoted. It‚Äôs pretty obvious, along with the lousy marketing for Shazam 2. They are trying to burn the remaining DCEU films so that they can make it look like they are the ‚Äúsaviors‚Äù of DC, saving the company from failure, to prop up their future movies and make them look good in comparison as if your film is absolute garbage, than even if the next one is mediocre it will look like an Oscar winning film."

DC_Cinematic,"10 Worst Things About Batman In The 2022 Movie. Robert Pattinson's new Batman is way cool, but he has a few downsides as well.","**10. Batman Indulges In Voice-Over** 

 By now, some movie fans might be tired of having characters dump information over their heads with voice-over narration to explain things, and at times, it's like an audiobook is nosing in on the cinematic experience. Maybe some fans don't mind, but others will, and Robert Pattinson's Batman totally does it.

Sometimes in *The Batman*, the titular character uses this time-worn trope once again and grimly explains his thought process, which feels heavy-handed, to say the least. In fact, some movies such as *The LEGO Batman Movie* make fun of the use of too-serious exposition, with or without a black screen.

**9. Bruce Wayne Has Unremarkable Fashion Sense** 

 No one is expecting Bruce Wayne to redefine the world of men's fashion, but even then, the Bruce Wayne depicted in 2022's *The Batman* fell short in this department. He is the wealthy prince of Gotham City, and he ought to dress the part when in public. Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne certainly did that.

In contrast, Pattinson's Bruce Wayne dressed himself up in surprisingly cheap-looking suits and coats in *The Batman*, and it looked like he was reluctant to dress up at all. It's a shame, since everyone likes a well-dressed man, vigilante or not.

**8. Batman Had No Special Personality Quirks** 

 It's not absolutely essential for Batman to have colorful character quirks, but if done right, such quirks can deepen and enrich the character, rather than muddle things. Christian Bale's Batman did that well, using a snarky tone and a few one-liners to add some freshness to the character. He was like a toned-down Tony Stark.

No one expects Batman to be a class clown, but even so, the Batman found in the 2022 movie had a rather dry personality even by *Batman* standards, which didn't really help. Yes, he was somewhat insecure and angsty, but it takes more than that to make a compelling, well-rounded personality.

**7. Batman Had Weak Personal Chemistry With Catwoman** 

 On a philosophical level, Batman and [the burglar Catwoman](https://www.cbr.com/batman-best-actresses-played-catwoman-ranked/) had fine chemistry as uneasy allies in 2022's *The Batman*. Both of them wanted to take down Falcone, but they had different views on the city and humanity as a whole, which made them tense and compelling allies.

On the downside, the characters had weak chemistry as Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, and they didn't personally mesh very well. That's a shame, and their philosophical chemistry didn't entirely make up for it. This Batman's love life is as weak as can be.

**6. Batman Didn't Have A Strong Ninja Vibe** 

 Batman is more than a caped vigilante with a cool bat-themed costume. Unlike his fellow Justice League members, Batman is a trained ninja, and he knows how to vanish into the shadows, perform incredible martial arts, throw bladed weapons, and much more. This was clearly shown in Christopher Nolan's own *Batman* trilogy.

However, Robert Pattinson's own Batman barely alluded to his ninja status at all. He may be stealthy and cautious, but otherwise, he said and did very little to suggest that he's a bonafide shinobi. That's a shame, since the ninja angle makes Batman that much cooler.

**5. Batman Has No Real Friends** 

 Bruce Wayne may not be the most sociable fellow in comic books, but even he appreciates the value of friendship, and in some incarnations of the characters, he has a solid social circle of his own. Christian Bale's version is a good example, having both Rachel Dawes and Harvey Dent as genuine friends.

Robert Pattinson's version of Batman evidently had no friends whatsoever, even if he did get along with Catwoman as partners, which is a shame. This poor, tormented Bruce desperately needs a friend to support him and cheer him up, but he had none. The screenplay was cruel to him in surprising ways, including this.

**4. Batman Had No Boss Battle To Fight** 

 It was exciting and intriguing to see this new Batman contend with an intellectually-inclined villain like the Riddler in their battle of wits. Unfortunately, this mental battle came at a serious cost - the new Batman was never properly challenged in personal combat. He had no boss battles to fight with enemies like Bane or Mr. Freeze.

Batman has thrilled his fans many times by using his ninja skills, advanced tactics, and cool gadgets to physically defeat foes much stronger than him, which makes him stand out from the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman, who rely more on brute force. But that didn't happen much in 2022's *The Batman*.

 **3. Batman Ran Out Of Clever Ideas By The End**

 Batman was a fine detective in most of *The Batman*'s runtime, and he was often even more clever and insightful than Christian Bale's or Ben Affleck's versions of the Dark Knight. The awkward part is that by the movie's end, this new Batman resorted to his worst trick - pleading with the villain to spill their secrets.

In many recent *Batman* movies, Batman grows desperate and effectively says ""Come on, tell me your secret plan!"" to the villain, such as vainly begging the Joker to tell him where Harvey and Rachel were hidden, or where a bomb's detonator was hidden. He did the same in *The Batman* when confronting the Riddler in Arkham, and of course, the Riddler didn't oblige him.

**2.** **Batman Had A Forgettable Batmobile** 

 The Batmobile is one of the most iconic elements of the series, and fans expect a lot from this famous DC vehicle. It has often been portrayed as a sleek black car with many hidden weapons and goodies inside, and Christian Bale's Batman had a Batmobile that was like an armored jeep with a motorcycle hidden inside.

However, Robert Pattinson's Batman drove an unremarkable Batmobile, which had the sole feature of a rocket booster in the back to catch up to the Penguin's own car. That's not bad, but it's also not very memorable, and the car was nearly wrecked in the movie. It's far from the character's best Batmobile.

 **1. Batman Had Mediocre Dialogue** 

 Batman often has really cool stuff to say in many of his comic, animated, or live-action incarnations, including the famous improvised ""I'm Batman"" line in [the 1989 *Batman* movie](https://www.cbr.com/movies-changed-director-producer-pre-production-improved/), among other quotes. In 2022's *The Batman*, the hero did have a cool line about the bat-signal doubling as a warning to criminals, but that's it.

Otherwise, this new Batman had rather dull and forgettable dialogue, even if he did spice things up just a little with ""I'm vengeance."" His dialogue wasn't clunky or inauthentic, but it was still unremarkable, and very little of it will be remembered in the coming years, which is a shame."

DC_Cinematic,I say just cast the Peacemaker stunt doubles for The DCU üòÇ,-
DC_Cinematic,Directors I could see directing Batman : The Brave &amp; The Bold,"First of all James Gunn already said that the movies of the DCU will come from unique visions and that while being interconnected they will almost feel almost in their own world similar to his gotg films in the mcu.

Secondly James is not a producer only but also a complete creative force in terms of directing and writing which do make him a more open to creative and diverse approaches respecting the director‚Äôs vision I also think he won‚Äôt go for a commercial approach while selecting his directors but almost follow the Feige formula of independent or breakthrough directors 

Thirdly Batman the Brave and the Bold will be primarly a father-son movie with a combination of superheroe elements that‚Äôs why the director should be able to create deep emotional and dynamic scenes between our protagonist  while also capable of big action and cgi ( the latter mostly as I think that Clayface will be either the main antagonist or secondary ) so here are my three choices for directors :

1.- Lee Isaac Chung : The director of Minari and an upcoming episode of the mandalorian. If you haven‚Äôt watched Minari I highly recommend you to, a very emtional drama in which we see the problems and racism an asian family suffers trough primarily from the perspective of both a father and his son. And with the upcoming episode while there is much to expect his involvement means he is open to commercial medium.

2.- Kogonda : Director of After Yang, a sci fi yet very ‚Äúin the ground‚Äù film with an unique approach &amp; beautifully filmed it related the story of a family and his robotic kid, my only con is that Kogonda is known for art house film and don‚Äôt really know if he eould be open to do a batman film.

3.- Charlotte Wells : The director of Aftersun which was named one of the best films of 2022, she is the definition of a breakthrough director with a promising future yet with aftersun being her solely film the lack of more experience with bigger budget would be her con."
DC_Cinematic,Current state of production in the DCU,"Creature Commandos: James Gunn started writing the project before he became Co-CEO of DC Studios, the writing is completely finished and they're now beginning casting with Frank Grillo likely voicing Rick Flag Sr.

Any other castings anytime over the next few months will probably be for the other Creature Commandos roles.

So no, Batman is not being casted tomorrow or next week and possibly not even this year. Be patient.

Reminder that casting always comes AFTER the screenplay is completed.

Superman: Legacy is likely far into the writing process since it's been in development for over six months. Writing processes can differ but it usually takes one screenwriter 3 months to write a first draft so it's most likely far into the rewriting process and being treated with great care since James knows how important a live-action Superman movie is to not only in general but also the added importance if it being the real start of his DC universe.

James may or may not let us know when the screenplay is completed but he did say major casting announcements will take place over the next six months so the Superman: Legacy cast may be what he's talking about.

Those two projects have been in production before Gunn's and Safran's promotions so every following project is their CEO ideas that have only been thought of post October 25th,2022 ( Gunn and Safran promotion announcement)

Waller's show-runners have been hired already. Jeremy Carver ( Executive Producer/ Show runner of Doom Patrol and Supernatural) and Christal Henry ( Writer of episode 4 of ""Watchmen"" and episode 7 of "" The First"") so expect it to still be in the ideas/writing stage. Casting for the series may or may not take place in 2023 but expect important characters to be introduced in this series. Every other project after this doesn't have any writers attached to the project yet.

The Authority is likely to arrive sometime after Waller. No writers or directors have been publicly attached to this project but we know it'll probably be the first major DCU film to release after Superman: Legacy.

Booster Gold's series is in the same boat as The Authority, no writers publicly hired on yet, which means no castings anytime soon.

Batman: The Brave and The Bold has no writers attached the project yet. I probably should put this in all caps so BATMAN ISN'T BEING CASTED UNTIL THE SCREENPLAY OF THIS FILM IS COMPLETED, STUDIOS CAST BASED OFF OF THE SCRIPT THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN. If you want to read the story inspiring this film to help you wait for the project then I suggest reading Grant Morrison's run on Batman. Also, just a reminder that an age range hasn't been confirmed by James Gunn so a lot of the rumours that he'll be in his late 20's or early to mid 30's is all speculation. What is not speculation is the fact that we will be definitely getting a new actor for this role.

The Lanterns series seems to have it's inspirations and setting set in stone by Gunn. No crew was announced by Gunn during the announcement so it's likely either early in the writing process or Gunn just really knows what the big picture of the series needs to be which is for it to be a True Detective inspired show that mostly earth based with John Stewart and Hal Jordan solving a mystery that'll be important for the DCU moving forward.

Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow will be inspired by Tom King's run on the character. I'm sure you can already guess that no crew has been announced but if you want to know what the story will resemble then read the comic run.

Paradise Lost will be a story of Themyscira (Paradise Island). It'll be inspired by Game of Thrones and will likely dive into the civil conflicts that precede Wonder Woman and will give other Amazonians the time to shine. No crew has been publicly hired yet but similar to Lanterns the big picture of the series seems to have been pitched by Gunn.

Swamp Thing reportedly has found its director in James Mangold ( Writer/Director of Logan and Ford v Ferrari and Director of Girl, Interrupted and The Wolverine). It'll be in the DCU but will likely be it's own thing that will eventually feed into the rest of the DCU's story in some ways. Expect it to be heavily inspired by Moore's legendary run of the character.

*""People have become beholden to \[release\] dates, to getting movies made no matter what. I‚Äôm a writer at my heart, and we‚Äôre not going to be making movies before the screenplay is finished.""*

\- James Gunn

Recent fan questions addressed by Gunn on twitter:

Fan: I think there was some confusion being you said Superman Legacy was there before you and Peter came in.

JG: It was. I was hired to write Superman Legacy over six months ago.

Fan: Does Wonder Woman have a future in your plans? Is she going to be abandoned for a long time.

JG: Yes; no.

Fan: Does it bother you that you can't make a post without people asking about DC and or complaining about DC?

JG: It only bothers me when it‚Äôs a post about someone dying or something tragic.

Fan: Will we get any major casting announcements in the next 6 months?

JG: Yes

Fan: there was no reason to change the cavil, if your superman is already going to have a child. what are you doing james? it's lost!!

JG: I never said Clark is going to have a child.

Fan: I'm cautiously optimistic, only because we keep hearing the big studios &amp; interests like to meddle in favor of spectacle &amp; ""catching up with the MCU"" To them I would say, ""Let James Gunn run his race, &amp; he will surpass the competition at a pace that will bring all fans w him""

JG: Peter and I are the studio. There is no one to meddle.

Fan: My biggest question and conspiracy theory is this. Have you been already in talks evens right before Peacemaker where you already in charge of DC Studios? Like was it a plan all along?

JG: Before Peacemaker? No way, not even close.

Fan: James can you confirm if Batmite will be the main character for chapters 1-6?

JG: Only in my heart.

Fan: how old will your new actor be for Batman? early 30s?

JG: He hasn‚Äôt been cast yet.

Fan: Have you got a dc collection? Comics/ figures/ art etc

JG: I have thousands of comic books, both DC &amp; Marvel.

Fan: Was Season 2 ( of Peacemaker) was cancelled right ???

JG: Heck no, just postponed while I work on Legacy. Waller first. PM after.

OP notes:

I really hope this can clear many things up for a lot of people. Speculation and fan casting is fun but it seems to get out of hand very easily. Stay interested and imaginative but don't spread misinformation. James is very open and we are blessed to have him put so much trust in the fans. So let's not burn him out or force him to be more secretive with announcements."

DC_Cinematic,Keaton Batsuits,"Which Keaton Batsuit is your favorite?

My favorite one was and always will be the 89‚Äô Batsuit. It‚Äôs bout the most realistic one next to Bale &amp; Pattinson. I was watching Batman 89‚Äô and I like he‚Äôs whole style and the vision Burton brought to the character. My only problem was his belt. Where in the hell did he put his grapnel gun? U never see it on his belt in any of the scenes. It just popped out when it was convenient. Bruce didn‚Äôt have any nano tech at the time so what gives. I was always a fan of the belt from the comics with the pouches. They were more practical and realistic. That‚Äôs just my opinion.

DC_Cinematic,why are there only 2 sides on the new flash movie?,So pretty much everyone agrees that the flash movie looks good but the 2 sides that seem to be taken is that people will forget what ezra Miller did because the fimn is good and that you shouldn't watch the movie because ezra Miller is in it. I think it's best to separate the movie from the actor since a movie like seven is amazing but Kevin spacey isn't. Idk it might just me be

DC_Cinematic,Does Superman Returns ever firmly establish that it takes place in 2006?,It‚Äôs been a headcanon of mine that it takes place simply five years after the last movie (that being 1985 or 1992 depending) and technology simply evolved quicker on that earth. Is the year itself ever mentioned in the film to contradict this headcanon?
DC_Cinematic,"Do you think the second Barry Allen in ""The Flash"" trailer is Reverse Flash?",-
DC_Cinematic,So who do you think the 4 out of 8 and 5 out of 10 characters James Gunn has teased are?,"My predictions are, for the 4 out of 8:

**Arsenal:** Don't think so, we don't even have Green Arrow yet.

**Terra:** Don't think so yet. Only if we get a Teen Titans Judas Contract movie.

**Kyle Rayner:** No way, he just said Lanterns is Hal Jordan and John Stewart, 2 is enough.

**Cassandra Cain's Batgirl:** Nah, he's definitely going for Babs. Especially since Leslie Grace's movie has been cancelled (brand diluting anyone?) Also, we might be getting Nightwing so yeah, Babs is the most likely Batgirl.

**Vixen:** Maybe? She had her own show, looks like they're trying to push her into the mainstream a bit more.

**Static:** Maybe? He could be very cool, love the Static Shock TV show as a kid. No reason to think he might be involved tho.

**Jon Kent:** Very likely, we're already getting Damian and the Supes movie is called LEGACY.

**Nightwing:** Definitely. Batfamily confirmed for Brave and the Bold AND he's in both lists?

&amp;#x200B;

And for the 5 out of 10, I think it's a bit harder:

**Nightwing:** See above.

**Red Hood:** I mean can you really do the Batfamily without the dynamics that Jason provides? Maybe he won't be in Brave and the Bold but he's DEFINITELY planned.

**Brainiac:** Bottle City of Kandor also ties into Superman LEGACY so I think it's a maybe.

**Mister Freeze:** I mean we all want to see him right? Maybe? If he doesn't get used by Matt Reeves first.

**Constantine:** Would really love to see him in Swamp Thing but I think the Keanu sequel may put him out of the picture at the moment.

**Zatanna:** I'm not sure. She's been pushed to the front a couple of times, like Vixen, even on the YJ and Harley Quinn shows. She might even be able to replace Constantine in Swamp Thing to be honest.

**The Court of Owls:** Would love to see it in live action. No any real indication as to why they would be used tho, except maybe the Batman vs. Robin animated movie plot or the pseudo-confirmation of Nightwing.

**Deathstroke:** Not unless we're getting a Teen Titans movie, same as Terra I guess. Yeah he could be a Batman villain but we JUST had Matt Reeves pass on that exact pitch, don't think Gunn is keen on recycling ideas.

**Lobo:** I'd say yeah but we're still getting Aquaman 2 AFTER The Flash which is supposed to be the reboot so I'm confused. If it's not Momoa then I don't think so. And I don't think it's Momoa. So I guess that's a no.

**Martian Manhunter:** Don't think so. It'd be hard for him to carry a solo movie/show and we have no talks about a JL movie whatsoever. Also I dunno but it might be too close to the Snyder Cut and they may wanna steer clear of comparisons."

DC_Cinematic,A Western DC movie idea,"I grew up watching western movies like The Magnificent Seven (1960) and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966) and I miss the days where we would see a great western movie with a lot of effort placed into it and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm gonna pitch this as an idea. 

Disclaimer: 
I‚Äôm aware this will never happen, it‚Äôs just a thing I thought of and I thought I‚Äôd see what other people thought of the concept.

The movie would take place in 1881 and it would follow a bounty hunter who seeks to claim the biggest reward ever placed on a criminals head. Throughout the movie we would see a huge cat and mouse game where the bounty hunter would be chasing down the criminal however in the end the bounty hunter would be shot through the mouth and cheek creating a big scar on the bounty hunter‚Äôs face and leaving his mouth disfigured on one side, you‚Äôve probably guessed it now but the bounty hunter would obviously be Jonah Hex. I know I‚Äôm changing the origin of his scar here but it‚Äôs for the purpose of the story so it could fit logically into the historical accuracy of the events. 

As he‚Äôs shot another man would be the one to kill the criminal and that man‚Äôs name is Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett, also known as Sheriff Pat Garrett.

Now I haven‚Äôt fully fleshed everything out plot wise but if you are a fan of the whole cowboy/outlaw era you‚Äôve probably guessed from the sheriff who the criminal im talking about actually is but if not it‚Äôs one of the most iconic outlaws, Billy The Kid. 

I‚Äôm not great at writing storylines and I know this isn‚Äôt exactly the next Seven Samurai or anything like that off of the basic premise but I just think even without this being the story, DC making a good western featuring characters like Jonah Hex and Billy The Kid could be great for them because not only will it draw people in for being a dc movie but it‚Äôll also draw in an untapped audience when it comes to comic book movies because you‚Äôll get western fans coming to see the movie just for the setting."

DC_Cinematic,I think the Russo Bros. would have been the best choice to lead DC.,"In the hero space alone they're incredibly more accomplished than Gunn. 

-Captain America: Winter Soldier

-Captain America: Civil War

-Infinity War 

-Endgame

They've impacted the MCU much more than Gunn ever has and have shown they can nail an assortment of different characters as well as the interactions between them. 

I would have loved to see them in the DCU."
DC_Cinematic,I think this clarifies the Cavill situation with how he was ditched,-
DC_Cinematic,"For Superman, I suggest Josh Andr√©s Rivera (Chino from the West Side Story remake). I mean look at him - his facial structure just screams Superman. Most importantly though, he showed some real talent in WSS. To quote Dick Donner ""Why cast a star when you can make one?""",-

DC_Cinematic,"I mean, I'm mostly straight ;)",-
DC_Cinematic,Superman Legacy should use smaller scaled villains,"Superman Legacy should use smaller scaled villains to show Superman and how broad the DCU is. Instead of focusing on one coming villain, he should deal with a few villains throughout the movie. Another thing they should do is use the Daily Planet to show how expansive the universe already is with Superheroes and villains everywhere. This will quickly get audiences on board with the fact that The DC Universe is already big."
DC_Cinematic,How Old Will The Trinity Be?,"Since we know Superman will be younger then 40, and Batman *might* be a *few years* older how old do you think they will be? Or do you think they will be the same age? 

Gunn also saying he never said Superman will be 25 idt that meant she won‚Äôt be but just saying he never said that. 

Do you think within the DCUs timeline will the films happen close to each other or will this story span over like 7-8 years maybe a decade? 

Only time will tell but I wanna know what ur opinions are about these."

DC_Cinematic,In the Batman in the bold movie the first scene introducing Batman should also introduce the rest of the bat family.,"Like I can imagine then hunting down two face or something.

The first character you see is Batman pretty self explanatory. He‚Äôs starting attacking the goons, and then nightwing got his back. Batman calls his flashy, and dick says something about him ‚Äúbeing in a circus after all.‚Äù
  Then we either see bat girl or oracle make a snide remark at dick. Saying something like ‚ÄúIf I could still wear the suit I would punch that smug face off of you‚Äù or if she is batgirl punches some goon and says your lucky your so cute or I would punch that smug face off of you‚Äù

DC_Cinematic,Theory: Hal Jordan and John Stewart are investigating the White Martians,"Based off of everything we know about the Green Lantern show, the series will deal with Hal and John investigating a mystery that has big implications for the overall DCU.

The series is a terrestrial detective story, which sounds like a good place to introduce John Jones aka the Martian Manhunter. MM is a fan favorite who has yet to fully debut in the films, and is an integral member of the Justice League.

This is a very loose theory, but is it possible that the Lanterns show would deal with the White Martians? A race of militaristic shapeshifters who pose an overall threat to the human race? It would fit really well with the detective angle, but also incorporate the scifi elements we want from a Green Lantern show. 

I can imagine a scenario where the President is dead, and his corpse reveals a White Martian, which unravels a global conspiracy. Very much similar to Secret Invasion, but more focused on political infiltration rather than superhero infiltration."
