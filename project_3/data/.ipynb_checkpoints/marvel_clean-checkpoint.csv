marvelstudios,What do you think is wrong with the MCU?,"I want to preface this by stating I love Marvel, and I love the MCU. I've watched everything in the MCU (minus a few of the Netflix shows), and that includes everything in Phase 4. I've actively defended the MCU throughout Phase 4 and I continue to do so. That being said, I'm lot more critical now than ever because even someone like me who is willing to accept that Marvel isn't perfect is getting tired of the tropes and how they've handled their last batch of films and tv shows.

 So my question is what exactly is hurting the MCU? Because for while it was easy to say that the problems people were having with the franchise were from the loud minority, as it was easy to point at the generally positive reviews and box office success of Phase 4 (even during Covid) to dispute those criticisms. Thor: L&amp;T for instance has received generally average, leaning towards positive reviews, and made over 700 million dollars at the WW box office despite negative WOM online. But the same can't be said with Ant-Man: Quantumania. Negative reviews from critics, mixed reception among even the most die hard fans, and even though I personally enjoyed it, I can't lie and say part of me didn't want a better movie. 

Seeing the online discourse surrounding the MCU the past 2 years has been a headache as people try and clammer to come up with some logical reason as to why the public perspective toward the franchise has shifted to be so negative, even among its fan base. Trying to place blame on individual directors and writers, or even Feige or Disney itself. Using buzz phases like ""superhero fatigue"" and ""MCU is dying."" I can't begin to explain how often I've seen people online talk about their falling out of love of the MCU and how it should have ended with Endgame.

So what's the problem? At least what do I think the main thing hurting the MCU is? Oversaturation? Bad VFX? Overstaying its welcome? 

No, it's simply the bad writing. 

If you look at the writers and producers of everything released post-Endgame, and everything that's coming up in the near future, you'll notice that the writers Marvel has hired have little to no experience. Jeff Loveness who wrote Quantumania and is set to write Avengers: KD has nothing of note to his name besides a few episodes of Rick and Morty, and Feige thought it was a good idea to hire him to helm not just the movie kicking off the fifth phase of the MCU and introducing the next big bad, but also the first Avengers movie we've had in 6 years by the time of its release? 

The Marvels, Captain America: NWO, Blade, all of these projects are in the hands of people with few writing credits and the credits they do have are not that well received. Hell, the Fantastic Four reboot is being written by two guys whose only main writing credit is a 2013 comedy with negative-to-mixed reviews. The only 2 Marvel movies coming out that have writers of solid experience are Thunderbolts, whose writer worked on Thor: Ragnar√∂k and Godzilla vs Kong, and Deadpool 3, which is being written by the same writers as the first two. And none of this is taking the series into account.

I get it, Marvel wants to take risk and experiment, getting people relatively new to the industry to write for them, but I just don't understand how Feige can look at someone like Jeff Loveness, who to his credits does do a fantastic job with Rick and Morty, and say ""Hey, you've never written a single movie before, here's this massive Avengers-crossover event."" 

Also, I'm fully aware of the ""But the writers of Thor: The Dark World wrote Infinity War and Endgame"" argument, but that's not really a valid argument because at least they had experience writing movies before writing Thor. ""But the Russo Brothers' only credits before joining the MCU were poorly-received comedies!"" Yes, but that was back with Marvel was arguably still in its infancy and only released 2-3 projects a year. In 2023, as a multi-billion dollar company, Marvel shouldn't be cheap with who it hires to tell its stories, especially if it's aiming to release up to 5 or 6 projects a year and spreading Feige thin. Because if Feige really is the creative mastermind behind the Infinity Saga, it's clear he can't keep up with the amount of projects Marvel's releasing and should be more selective in hiring experienced storytellers who are guaranteed to delivered quality work. 

In conclusion, I love the MCU, so much so that I'm willing to stick with it throughout the growing pains it goes through in hopes that it can be better can capture that excitement that it once did. And in some regard, it has. No Way Home was simply amazing and the hype and excitement leading up to that was Infinity War-Endgame levels, that high comic book movie fans have been missing since the pandemic.  It's looking GOTG Vol.3 is also going to be something akin to that and I'm very much looking for to it. Beyond that however, I'm worried for Marvel's future. I am hopeful though, as recently news that they're focusing more on quality over quantity, even pushing back and delaying certain projects, gives me hope they're listening and learning.

TDLR; Marvel's biggest problem is simply bad writing and putting too much faith in the hands of writers and storytellers with little to no experience. In other words, being cheap to compensate for the large output of content they have to release."
marvelstudios,So i have an Spider-Man opinion:,"what if Homecoming was before Civil War but after AoU, and Far From Home was after Civil War but before Infinity War, with the reveal post credits scene happening before they get dusted, would the MCU have turned out better?

marvelstudios,"A bunch of Concepts and ideas for the ""Open Your Eye"" scene in Doctor Strange",-
marvelstudios,Should‚Äôve been The Wasp: Quantumania,"Janet Can Dyne/Michelle Pfeiffer as defacto lead. 

Cold open is the flash back to OG Ant-Man and Wasp taking out the rocket (as seen in the first (or second..) movie). 

Carrying on with Janet‚Äôs perspective. Have her in the Scott Lang role against Kang, act one being their first meet as we saw, and hope to escape with via his ship. Then the neural link showing his horrors. Rest of film sees Kang hunting her for remaining pym particles to fix his ship. 

She makes some rag tag friends that make her drink the red to understand them etc, befriends leader of resistance in place of Cassie‚Äôs role so film can more or less play out in same way. Though it takes place over the decades she was gone/had aged upon return rather than the short ish time frame of the actual film. 

At some point, she would stumble upon the signal that Scott had been there, and pickups her quest to return home as a secondary concern to killing Kang. 

The end of the film is the same ending as the second movie, but different in being from Janet‚Äôs perspective, as she‚Äôs saved from the Quantum realm by Hank, and retiring to a beach with him (though fearful, as scott was at the end, of the inevitable return of Kang/s). 

(Also something could specifically be seen to happen to Janet in her time in the quantum realm that allows her to fix ghost upon her return - putting that issue to bed)

(Scott and family would next be seen in an alternate 3rd Ant-Man film/series, nice and grounded, though maybe featuring a load of Young Avengers, of Luis, and hopefully Goggins)"

marvelstudios,Interesting inconsistencies with the Quantum Realm?,"So after recently watching Quantumania, which I enjoyed a lot, I found myself wondering a few things regarding the Quantum Realm's place among the MCU 616 Universe.


In this movie, we meet Kang. This fella is seemingly from a completely different universe, and was exiled by his variants to a place ""outside of space and time"" to stop his multiversal tomfoolery. This all leads us to believe that across EVERY universe, there is only ONE Quantum Realm. If this is true, oh man, it messes things up *big time*.


To explain why this makes a mess, let's look at the fact that the Sacred Timeline of the MCU (616) is dependent on a couple of interactions with the Quantum Realm in order for Thanos to be defeated.
These interactions are:

- Janet Van Dyme being sent to the Quantum Realm

- Darren Cross being sent to the Quantum Realm via suit sabotage, which was done by Scott ALSO going to the Quantum Realm

- Janet communicating a signal or something like that to Scott during his time there, causing the plot to Ant Man and the Wasp

- Janet being rescued, discovering that healing particles exist in the Quantum Realm, and sending Scott on a mission to retrieve more. Then, while Scott's balls deep in the healing particles, the whole Pym Crew gets snapped by Thanos.

- And finally, Scott being rescued by a curious rodent, and using his newfound knowledge of the Quantum Realm's influence on time to time travel and initiate the plot of Endgame.

If there is only ONE Quantum Realm across the entire multiverse, which we have been led to believe...Then, because of the nature of the multiverse, there should be MULTIPLE Janets within the Quantum Realm, among MULTIPLE disfigured Darrens, and above all of them, MULTIPLE Scotts floating in the time voids.


It's possible we've seen one of the multiple other Janets in What If? The Janet who contracted the zombie virus and caused a zombie apocalypse. But despite Feige saying that What If? is canon to the MCU multiverse, I feel they made that show without that in mind (still loved it tho!)


That's the end of my rant. I hope to God this is legible to you guys."

Some may say that it's not right comparing Thanos and Kang, and his yelling about who he is is a way of showing how arrogant and narcissistic Kang is (he used to compare himself to Alexandr Makedonian in the comics). He's seeking fame and respect throughout the whole multiverse. Meanwhile, Thanos seeks no respect or fame and just does his business one way or another. He doesn't create statues of himself like Kang (as we've seen at the end of Loki season 1).   
I would just say that it's lazy writing. There million ways of showing the villain's perspective of the world and revealing his nature. You can't take seriously a guy who screams ""I AM KANG? DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY AVENGERS I'VE KILLED? DO YOU KNOW HOW POWERFUL I AM""? It's Ronin\\Malekith threat level.

I believe that the ‚ÄúProbability Storm‚Äù created by having infinite Kang variants within the multiversal engine core will in fact grow into what we now know of as ‚ÄúAlioth‚Äù and of the infinite Kang variants within the core, one variant will learn to harness the power of Alioth, destroy all other variants within the multiversal engine core, return to a point in the mainstream multiverse outside of the multiversal engine core, and win the multiversal war with Alioth on his side.

TLDR: We just saw the origin story for the NEW ‚ÄúHe Who Remains‚Äù in this NEW iteration of the multiversal war. Also, we may have seen the origin of the ‚ÄúNull-Time Zone‚Äù dimension where the TVA is actually located now.

marvelstudios,Watched the movie Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantamania; Any Thoughts?,"I'd like to talk about my gripes with this movie. Personally I thought that the movie was a rough start to Phase 4 of the MCU. The CGI was a mixed bag for me with the environment being very well designed. Though, there are many CGI parts that feel very out of place like MODOK and the battle of ants. The humor wasn't very great despite the focus the MCU has taken toward humor. I've noticed most MCU films has been too focused on the extended universe and isn't focused on making a great movie. Movies like Shang-Chi and Wakanda Forever were pretty good for me and these movies are definitely less rooted in MCU. The action definitely has less tension then other films. Spider Man No Way Home and even Multiverse of Madness had me more tense and into the action than this film. The humor is poorly placed in the action scenes though this may not be on purpose since MODOK in the action scenes kills the tension for me entirely."

Matt's struggle with Elektra was well written to me, as it was prominent, but didn't consume his entire character. 

I am pretty sad that Stick is dead, but that felt like a moment that really showed Elektra's development.

It was nice seeing Bakuto again, as he was a great villain from Iron Fist Season 1. 

I've already see the first episode of Daredevil Season 3, and it's great. I can't wait to see what is called the Best Marvel Netflix Season.

marvelstudios,The Spider-man trilogy is the most perfect trilogy in the MCU,"Firstly I'm not saying ""it's the best trilogy and the other trilogies suck!!""

I'm talking about the tone, script, director, music etc. 

All three movies have the exact same tone and style thanks to having the same director and writers throughout. Something I wish marvel would do more often (I realize sometimes ""creative differences "" happen) but it just works so well with this trilogy. 

The musical theme is also the same throughout. It bugs the HECK out of me when character themes change. Iron man never had the same theme. Thor never had the same theme. Micheal Giacchino was the composer for all three Spider-man movies so guess what? SAME theme throughout. I just think it feels so incoherent when a movie theme changes. 

Not sure how marvel was able to pull this off so easily and not with any other trilogy but I hope marvel sticks with consistency."

In contrast, the explanation given in the eternals as to why they were not involved in prior events is quite flimsy. They couldn‚Äôt intervene unless they.. did. And the motivation for wanting to save earth is that humans are ‚Äúsomehow different. There‚Äôs something special^TM about them‚Äù

What other details have you found very satisfying. Ideally the more significant to the plot the better, but smaller details count! For example, the fact that the time stone is somehow different in that it consistently seems to not be directly touchable."

Is there any behind the scenes stuff that's as interesting as what we get to see on the big screen? Any suggestions and all recommendations welcome!"

marvelstudios,"What characters do you want to see Kang interact with, fight and potentially beat in a fight?","Jonathan Majors left such an impact that I want to see him shared scenes with as many characters possible. Which ones do you want to see, whether if it's Kang Dynasty/Secret Wars or in another project leading up to them. How would you want it to go down?

My main picks are Shang-Chi, Captain Marvel and Namor. 

1.) I want an epic one-on-one duel with Shang-Chi against Kang while using the 10 rings.

2.) Carol should fight him in a DBZ-inspired showdown, but not as long, to stall for time or to bring him down. 

3.) You guessed it, a fight of not just Namor with Kang, but to see a full showcase of the power of both armies against each other."
marvelstudios,Thoughts on M.O.D.O.K,"There seems to be a widespread notion on this sub that M.O.D.O.K could not have been adapted into live-action without him being a joke and looking goofy. Anyone who's played *The Avengers* know that this is not the case. (I'm aware games aren't live-action but the character is mostly CGI anyway). His design and characterisation in the game makes him frightening and grotesque. Design-wise, reducing the size of his head and increasing the amount of protruding weaponry makes him look less ridiculous, as it makes the head and limbs less prominent and makes him look more octopus-like, which gives him some familiarity. The head itself is also much more wrinkled and scarred, which makes him look more monstrous, and his expressions and the shadows under his eyes make him seem more sinister. As he is the main antagonist and not a comic relief character, he is shown to be a real threat through his actions and his voice and dialogue also feel threatening. Paired with his design, this means he is taken seriously by the heroes.

Not all of these elements are necessary for a serious portrayal of M.O.D.O.K, and a serious portrayal of M.O.D.O.K isn't necessarily better than a non-serious one (I liked the animated show), but my point is that it could have been done. For the record, my only issue with M.O.D.O.K's design in Ant-Man and The Other One: Quantumania was his face, specifically the way it was just a normal face but enlarged and stretched (and I think that the CGI wasn't very good). Refer to this [fan-art](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/11br7mv/modok_redesign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) as an example of how it could have looked. Everything else I really liked, especially the addition of the mask, which was actually intimidating, unlike his face. Also, my main issue with him in terms of writing was that the motivation of his betrayal of Kang (""Don't be a dick"") didn't make any sense and was played off just for laughs, as was his death, which shouldn't have even happened in the first place. I believe his betrayal should have stemmed from his growing disdain for Kang's treatment of him as a lesser being, something that is barely explored in the film, rather than a total and sudden turn to the good side. He could have also made a great recurring villain and been used to setup the introduction of AIM."

marvelstudios,'Daredevil: Born Again' NEEDS to nail the tone,"Since Charlie Cox's Daredevil returned in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home', fans have been both excited and concerned about his future appearances in the MCU. Most people seemed to enjoy his role in 'She-Hulk' but there really wasn't a lot of room for them to screw it up. That show was intended to be more comedic and they made us aware of that months in advance so that the backlash wouldn't be too heavy. Most people seemed to realise that and just appreciate it for what it was.

For his own show, the bar is set WAY higher. This isn't a small role in someone else's movie or show. This is a brand new show that focuses on the man himself. It's the follow-up to what many consider to be the greatest Marvel show ever made and one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. People ADORE 'Daredevil' and one of the reasons why is because it's so different from what we normally get from the MCU. It doesn't interrupt dramatic moments with silly jokes that break all tension, it doesn't rely on overwhelming amounts of CGI, and it doesn't feature things that are clearly only there to setup the next 5 projects. It's a gritty, violent and extremely mature show. Something Marvel Studios is yet to give us.

The reason why I specifically mentioned the tone and not other aspects like casting, choreography, budget, etc. is because they've already proven they can nail all of those things. They've got Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio as the leads, they've already given us a gritty hallway fight, and the other shows have shown us how much money is being thrown into these productions. The one thing that's a big question mark is the tone.

My hope is that the new show will include less of this type of humour:

*Processing video yiwam5fgbkla1...*

...and more of this type of humour: 

*Processing video m2hzj0dibkla1...*

I'm preparing for the worst but still hoping that they'll manage to not fuck it up. I guess time will tell."

marvelstudios,"Marvel should embrace smaller budgets (and more ""experimental"" stories)","Ant-Man 3 will need to make at least 500 million dollars to break even, due to its huge budget (200 million) along with marketing costs and a share of the box-office going to theatres. As it looks now, it may just barely cross that 500 million dollar mark -- which doesn't leave much profit.

In my opinion, Ant-Man 3 could've been a way more personal end to a trilogy, and I believe the movie's unnecessarily huge budget was detrimental in that. Think of Fox's Logan: The movie cost half of what Marvel spent for Ant-Man 3, and it therefore had to be a much more small-scale, personal story. But the movie still earned 600 million dollars (and was universally acclaimed!).

Don't get me wrong, Marvel has mastered the Avengers-level blockbusters, but I think there is space for stories where the universe isn't at stake, stories without a CGI-fest. Ant-Man 3 could've been a deeply personal tale about a father who has to grapple with missing out his daughter's most important years of her life. We got something different."

This I feel would also make the &gt;!Council of Kangs!&lt; seen later feel insurmountable rather than cheesy. And then after the credits are done, while still feeling the ""we lost"" malaise, BOOM! Post credits scene shows that this wasn't ""616"" Scott and family the whole time, we've been following a Scott and Hope from a different universe the whole movie. Phase 5 would come in with a bang and we would also have a better after credits than just a scene from Loki season 2.

marvelstudios,Questions about What If infinity stone lore,"Since in What If when Ultron had no other magical abilities other than the Infinity Stones, does that make it canon that with all 6 stones one can travel the multiverse? Also in Loki they established that the stones don‚Äôt at the TVA, do they only not work there or do they not work anywhere outside their native universe, if so how did Ultron use the power of his stones in other universes. Sorry if this has been asked but found it interesting to think on."
marvelstudios,What do you desire for the future of the MCU after the multiverse saga?,"The title basically says it all. What do you want to happen after the multiverse saga? Do you want them to make drastic changes, or just move onto another arc? What arcs and storylines would you like to see? Do you want the multiverse to continue being important after the saga is done, or do you want the arcs to go back to only Earth 616?

For me, I think I would like to see multiple arcs going on at the same time. I know that makes things way more complicated for the studio, but I think they need to change it up a bit. The first two sagas have been somewhat linear. Telling only one major story at a time. Maybe it would be cool to see a couple major stories happening at the same time and then try to connect them somehow. I'm just spitballing though, so maybe this would ultimately not be very good. 

What are your thoughts? I would love to hear everyone's ideas and theories!"
marvelstudios,Confusion about Loki and the Sacred Timeline,"So first of all: my understanding of the Sacred Timeline goes: it's a bunch of realities ""walking"" together, some with minor differences from one another, but all following the same story/script. A Nexus Events happens when something in one of those realities follows another path instead of the predetermined one.

Idk if that's correct, but when a Nexus Event happen in one of those realities, it indicates that at that moment, that was the ""present"" of said reality. (Since, in the pov of that reality, things were just happening in ""their present"" and then the TVA shows up there to prune it).

Now here's where my confusion starts: in Loki Episode 2, Loki and Mobius go to Pompeii to test the apocalypse theory. That would mean that, even if the timeline didn't branch, in that reality Loki and Mobius were there during Pompeii. Even if no one knows, it's kinda carved in that reality that they were there. (Someone correct me if i'm wrong pls)

Same goes to Sylvie, when she's hiding in the 2050 apocalypse. That would mean that, in that reality, even if not branched, it's carved that Sylvie and the TVA show up there in 2050, everything is destroyed by the tornado and the events keep moving.

So how exactly did the TVA found precisely where Sylvie was? They knew she was in 2050 and before the apocalypse, but if the reality Sylvie was is just another one from trillions of realities that exist within that moment of the Sacred Timeline, how did the TVA knew exactly which one to go?"
marvelstudios,Why the Eternals should have never been made into a movie,"Tbh eternals on its own is a terrible idea to adapt. Its best shown as in the comics as the third part of the star gods saga. Starting with jack Kirby's run if thor until Ragnarok then thats the death of the old gods. Then the new gods rise up from their ashes over in dc with jack Kirby's new gods, the conclusion to new gods was in the short lived marvel series captain victory followed by the eternals where the old gods (this time its the celestials) come to judge the new gods (the eternals were made to be marvels version of the new gods since dc owned the new gods characters)

Theirs many shots like the last page of jack Kirby's thor run and the start of new gods that tie it together, black mass being a darkseid cast in shadow because of rights issues and the whole character of thanos was to be marvels darkseid due to darkseid being was shown in new gods but his origins couldn't be done until jack was back in marvel where he explained it

So adapting eternals or reading the eternals comics were kinda terrible as a stand alone thing so the movie kinda suffered for it. Theirs nothing marvel could have realy done but i dont think the eternals should have been adapted foe that reason"

marvelstudios,"MCU ""Connective Tissue"" Power Rankings Part 5: 2016","Hey again! Trying to make sure I keep posting while I can, probably the last one for the week though. This time we're adding the entries from 2016, and I think this one has the least amount of major changes, which I guess makes sense, but I can also see some newer characters flying up the rankings as I pour over the appearances. Without further ado, lets get started.

1. **Tony Stark / Iron Man** (Previous: 1st)- Stark has the largest of supporting roles in *Captain America: Civil War*, you can argue he's the villain. Either way, he continues to be a driving force in the overall story, even if he doesn't have movies of his own anymore.

2. **Agent Phil Coulson** (Previous: 2nd)- Every season of *Agents of SHIELD* is better than the last, and the fourth season is fully under way at this point. Hard to believe the show made it this far with how vanilla those early episodes were. Tie-ins to the movies were smart, but it's at the point where the show is standing on it's own.

3. **Nick Fury** (Previous: 3rd)- Fury takes the year off, but I don't think he's going to lose his third spot for a quick minute.

4. **Steve Rogers / Captain America** (Previous: 4th)- Cap closes the gap on the top 3 though. He's officially threatening to be the first to jump into the top 3 since I started doing this, and I suspect he will.

5. **Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow** (Previous: 6th)- While not having her movie yet, Nat has one of the best arcs that runs through all of her appearances across the Iron Man, Avengers and Captain America franchises. 

6. **Thor Odinson** (Previous: 5th)- Thor drops a little for *mostly* taking the year off, he did make a quick appearances in the One-Shot *Team Thor* which we should not forget lol.

7. **James Rhodes / War Machine** (Previous: 9th)- Being consistent is the name of the game here, and nobody has been more consistent than Rhodey after a slightly rocky start. Can't say he's had much of an arc, but that's not the criteria here.

8. **Agent Peggy Carter** (Previous: 8th)- Having your own show really helps maintain your relevance, but this is the year we said goodbye to Margaret Carter (except for time travel), so expect her to drop as we go forward. 

9. **Bruce Banner / Hulk** (Previous: 7th)- Not much to say about Hulk here. He has coffee with Thor. They both have better adventures next year. 

10. **Howard Stark** (Previous: 15th)- Howard Stark is the character we can't get away from. He's in *Agent Carter* Season 2, and has a quick AI/Death Cameo in *Captain America: Civil War*. I would have never thought he would climb this high, but it's a testament to how pervasive he is. 

11. **Clint Barton / Hawkeye** (Previous:16th) - Finally! Our boy feels like he belongs amongst his peers. A joke with BP aside, Clint is now one of the most established characters. 

12. **Pepper Potts** (Previous: 10th)- An ominous couple of mentions in *Civil War* give context as to why we haven't seen Pepper, She'll be back though! So don't expect her to fall too far.

13. **Erik Selvig** (Previous: 11th)- I don't think we see him again? With the move to three movies a year, I think it's only a matter of time before he falls.

14. **Maria Hill** (Previous: 12th)- Like Fury, she took the year off, so like her contemporaries, she drops two spots. 

15. **Sam Wilson / Falcon** (Previous: 18th)- Another great supporting role for Sam. He's the newest introduced character on the list to be this high, and you can see why. He's incredibly likeable.

16. **Jasper Sitwell** (Previous: 13th)- Another early Icarus character who flew to close to the top. His early contributions were invaluable, but now we will see him slowly fall off.

17. **Loki Laufeyson** (Previous: 14th)- The bleeding stops here for Loki though, we should see him rise again after this list.

18. **Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier** (Previous: NR)- Bucky was on the 2014 list, but fell off last time, we'll see how much staying power he has moving forward. 

19. **Daisy Johnson / Quake, Melinda May, Grant Ward / Hive, Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz** (Previous: NR)- I'm gonna cheat a bit and give the last two spots to the five longstanding cast members of *Agents of SHIELD*. I refuse to pick between them all, and I really wanna acknowledge the show and it's importance to this point. The accomplishments are amazing, and they are the engine alongside Coulson.

I thought that was the explanation Loki gave to us, but the Sacred Timeline worked as a circle (meaning the end and the beggining of the timeline are the same moment).

With Vin Diesel as Groot

With Bradley Cooper as Rocket

With Gwyneth Paltrow

With Robert Redford

With Josh Brolin as Thanos

With Chris Pratt (really?)

He kinda reminds me of Coulson. Owen Wilson is perfect in this role and I can't imagine anyone else playing Mobius. His chemistry with Tom Hiddleston is off the charts.

marvelstudios,The problem with phase 4 is the marketing,"I haven't watch a single MCU movie in the theaters since Far From Home (i watch them on Disney +), and I feel like the reason is the marketing, they don't try to sell movies anymore, the way they talk about them in the interviews and trailers is always about the next chapter in the MCU and how important it is for the next phase; but they dont sell me this movie, the one they're promoting, at some point it feels like an expansion for the MCU more than a movie.

I love martial arts films, and I wasn't hyped for Shang-Chi, I enjoyed it when I saw it, but I love asian martial arts films... so a mayor Hollywood film brings Jackie Chan's stunt unit to work in this Marvel movie, but they don't talk about that, they talk about how Shang Chi is gonna be an important figure in the MCU and that this movie explores new things inside the universe... and im like cool, but why would I care about THIS movie, like this one specific, maybe the next 10 that you set up sound awesome, but you're not putting those on theater's right now... so promote this specific movie.

And I feel that these applies to a lot of the decisions for the movies and TV shows, they focus on the set up first and a way to sell the product first, and then they make a story around it; because most of the cast from Eternals is irrelevant to the plot, Ironheart is a main character in wakanda forever, the post credit scene of moonknight basically ruining the mysterious ending of the show so everyone can be like omg its the other personality, or why is Monica Rambeau so relevant in Wandavision.

I don't think the products have worst quality because the writers or the directors are not talented, they had Chloe Zhao that won an Oscar for best movie to direct Eternals, but if you give her 10 characters that she needs to introduce and juggle for a story about 3 of them, yeah the movie is gonna suck"

I have been haunted by Loki saying ‚ÄúThe sun will shine on us again.‚Äù [https://youtu.be/5kYKvLrLieE](https://youtu.be/5kYKvLrLieE) since IW. I think he was telling the truth, and the Loki series will provide the answer to how this happens.

When he enters the TVA he sees his death, [https://youtu.be/0AqVwRG8v2g](https://youtu.be/0AqVwRG8v2g). He also sees that he can bring hope and peace to the universe, that he is capable of change.

Much later, he learns from Classic Loki how to cheat death by tricking Thanos, [https://youtu.be/5Azb3qxtrXU](https://youtu.be/5Azb3qxtrXU). But Classic Loki is eventually trimmed by the TVA before he attempts to become un-lonely. So the only way ‚Äúthe sun will shine on Loki and Thor again‚Äù is if 616 Loki tricks Thanos like Classic Loki did AND eliminates the TVA. Then 616 Loki can travel back to the point where he took the tesseract to mend his timeline, as Captain America did with the stones at the end of Endgame. I hope we get a replay of the Asgard ship scene with Loki in a dark corner, projecting an illusion for Thanos to kill before becoming a piece of debris that is scattered into space.

marvelstudios,[Spoilers] [Analysis] Trying to get my head around Quantumania,"There was a lot to like in this movie... but I didn't like it, and I'm trying to understand why.

Going in, I said I wanted three things:

1. Good special effects
2. A dozen or so good one-liners
3. A sense of dread for the upcoming phase

I kind of got all three but was left going, ""meh."" So why?

These are the things that I think rubbed me the wrong way, in no particular order:

* Everything felt really small (no pun intended) - So many scenes were a great big, digital matte painting in the background; a handful of extras in the middle-distance; and 2-3 characters in the foreground. After a while it just felt like a stage play.
* Lots of new characters introduced with little or no development - Hell, the ""I like holes"" guy was probably the most deeply explored character outside of the main cast and Bill Murray's character.
* Stakes were super-low - We know Kang is coming, but we also know that he's got lots of variants, so whether or not he escapes is unimportant to the threat he poses. Given that, we're concerned about what? It seems clear he won't kill anyone right up until they actively start destroying his plans.
* Attempts at heartwarming moments fell flat for me - I'm really sick of the ""I'm stuck in an impossible situation, but I think of my love for [spouse, parent, child] and suddenly the impossible is possible,"" trope.
* The movie kept going ""secret cameo mode!!!"" - Every time someone was going to get introduced, we'd get the secret cameo cam. By the time we got to the third person that was introduced with blurry shots from behind, first-person view, shoe-level shots, etc. I was just done. At MOST one per movie please!
* No Luis!

But like I say, I didn't hate it. There was a lot to like. Jonathan Majors is excellent (though I wish he'd been more ""on"" as Kang... this felt like a directorial decision more than Majors' limitations). Some of the CG was awesome. The jokes didn't all land, but the ones that did got me to laugh out loud. The opening montage was really well done, and probably the most heartwarming thing in the movie.

But yeah... just ""meh."""

marvelstudios,3rd movie epic &amp; set in the Quantum Realm = The PERFECT way to conclude the Ant-Man trilogy,"I enjoyed Quantumania quite a bit, even though I do see many of the criticisms leveled against it as valid.

One criticism that I completely disagree with, however, is that it didn't ""feel like an Ant-Man movie"".  eg. because Ant-Man movies are ""supposed to be small-scale, heist films"" and NOT epic adventures, or that this movie did not fit well with the two previous entries.

On the contrary, I think this was a PERFECT way to round out the Ant-Man trilogy, and that the trilogy as a whole IS cohesive unto itself with the final chapter being an organic payoff to all that had been setup previously.

Ant-Man 1: Teased the Quantum realm, revealed that Janet was stuck there for 30 years, showed that quick flash of the Janet's silhouette as Scott was returning from the QR, and showed Hope's Wasp suit in the end credits scene.

Ant-Man 2: Paid off EVERYTHING that had been setup in part one-- Scott's successful round trip to the QR in the first film paved the way for Janet to be retrieved (this was the driving force of the entire second movie).  We've spent two movies hearing about Janet van Dyne and her 30 years in the QR but yet we see so little of her or find out so little of her history once she returns.  Also, there's the easter egg of the silhouette of the city inside the QR.  And although we see a BIT of the QR, it's still basically just a big tease up until this point.  And Cassie has all her comments about wanting to be a hero like her dad.

Basically, if you had asked me prior to Quantumania what a satisfying payoff to all the remaining setup from Chapter 2  would be in order to round out the trilogy in a satisfying matter, it would be this list:

* Finally give us JANET as a fully-featured character in her own right
* Also, tell us what Janet was up to for those 30 years in the QR
* Show us what was up with that city/cities/etc. in the QR
* Let's see older Cassie take on that heroic identity she's obviously destined for
* BONUS: Show us what happened to Darren Cross when he shrunk down to subatomic range (eg. when it happened to Scott, he went to the QR-- why wouldn't the same thing have happened to Darren?)

And point by point, this is exactly what the movie gave us.  After only dipping our toes increasingly into the QR for the first two movies, we FINALLY got to fully dive in.  That's what I most wanted to see in an Ant-Man 3, and that's EXACTLY what they delivered!  Peyton Reed and the Marvel team did a GREAT job of building a satisfying trilogy which feels like a true cohesive story.

(Think of it this way: If they had given us a third Ant-Man movie that was just another small-scale, San Francisco-based heist film, I think we all would have felt that NOT ever getting a grand QR adventure was just such a waste of potential and setup, like... why did they even bother teasing us about it so much for the first two movies if it hadn't been the plan to REALLY GO there, all along?)

What ELSE would a satisfying trilogy conclusion for Ant-Man be, other than having an epic adventure in the QR itself?  (Kind of like in the original Star Wars trilogy... In Ep 4, you hear the emperor get mentioned by name only, then in Ep. 5, you see him in hologram form, then... for the conclusion in Ep. 6 you spend an entire movie in his friggin' throne room where he's the fully-realized antagonist of the movie whose defeat is the climax of the entire trilogy.  For a trilogy about rebels fighting an evil empire, of course the conclusion would feature the Emperor's downfall.  For a trilogy of shrinking, science-based adventurers dangerously interacting with the vast mystery of the QR with increasingly perilous results... of course the conclusion would revolve around an intense and full exploration of that place.

You may argue of course, that you didn't like the plot, the dialogue, the character development (or lack thereof) etc..

But in terms of theme, scope and general premise, this movie was right on the money as a cohesive trilogy capper-- taken collectively as a trilogy the Ant-Man films are WAY more cohesive than say, the three Iron Man or three Thor movies taken collectively.  (Captain America worked similarly well as a trilogy that consistently developed a theme and characters.)"

IMO, much of what's wrong with the film can be attributed to its near total lack of grounding in any sort of reality that's relatable to the audience.  They went balls to the wall wacky, but there was no hook back to the real world to counterbalance that zaniness.

The solution would have been so simple...  

Immediately have the Ant fam discover that they can communicate back their lab equipment in some way, but no one is there to hear them...until Luis arrives to meet Scott about another book signing, because he's actually become Scott's talent manager!

Luis answers their calls in a panic and they relay to him that he needs some tech macguffin to re-open a portal for them back from the Quantum realm. 

For the rest of the film, we bounce back to Luis for some Earth-based comic relief as he struggles to accomplish the tasks set forth by a frustrated Hank Pym, until he assembles the parts required to open the portal just as they are fighting Kang, who attempts to jump through.  They all yet all Luis to close the portal as he's smiling proudly that he finally got it open.

He closes it just as Kang is about to make it through.  The team beats Kang narrowly and asks Luis to open the portal again, who complains that they need to make up their minds.  The Ant family escapes and everything plays out the same in the end.

Would have gotten us more Luis and given a juxtaposition between the Quantum realm and Earth for audiences to find their grounding points.

marvelstudios,"[Spoilers] If They're Going After Everyone Who's Touched The [Spoiler], Then Kang Dynasty Is Going To Be HUGE","We see in the Quantumania post-credit scene that the Three Variants (Immortus, Rama-Tut and presumably Scarlet Centurion) are going after the Avengers for beginning to interact with the Multiverse. Because of Endgame and Loki, we know that time travel also constitutes interacting with the Multiverse.

Everyone who's messed with the Timeline/Multiverse in the Cinematic Universes (FOX-Men, MCU, SONYverse) should not only be targets of the Kangs, there's also precedent for them fighting in the comics as well!

- X-Men; created a branched timeline and/or rewrote their own timeline (?) in Days of Future Past. Fought Kang in the shockingly canon crossover with Star Trek.

- Spider-Man; both Tobey and Andrew were brought into No Way Home, while Miles, Gwen and Dadbod Peter interacted with the Multiverse in Spider-Verse. Peter Parker fought Kang as early as Avengers #11.

- Deadpool/Cable; while I don't believe Deadpool ever fought Kang, Cable fought Rama-Tut in Cable #57.

- Legion; while I don't believe Legion has ever faced Kang in the comics, his show visited several alternate realities.

Starting with characters/franchises in the MCU:

- The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. traveled to alternate realities in Seasons 4 (the Framework), 5 (the Destroyed Earth) and 7 (the History Altered by the Chronicoms). On Earth-16112, they prevented Scarlet Centurion from murdering Odin, which would've caused the Asgardians to wipe out all life on Earth.

- The Runaways, a Chase Stein from 2028 and the remaining Runaways from 2021 traveled back to 2018 to successfully prevent Morgan le Fay from murdering Gert Yorkes. The Runaways of Earth-2912 were actually formed into their reality's Young Avengers by Iron Lad, though him and Kang were killed by Ultron's son, Victorious, in an attempt to kill the Runaways. (It's messy.)

- The Avengers are Kang's main target throughout all of his schemes, and they famously played jump rope with the Multiverse in Endgame. Two characters that were not involved with the Time Heist but have a massive history with Immortus are Scarlet Witch and Mantis. He wanted to impregnate both of them (and Agatha Harkness, who was an old woman at the time) in order to father the Celestial Messiah. Spoiler alert, the mother, the Celestial Madonna, would end up being Mantis. Her husband? Jack Duquesne from Hawkeye.

- Loki; while I don't believe the two were ever in conflict with one another, they were teammates on the Cosmic Avengers. Along with Scott Lang, and Kamala Khan.

- Captain Carter; traveled the Multiverse in the What If season finale. Has never battled Kang in the comics, but Peggy Carter went head-to-head with Kang, even using Steve's shield against him, in an episode of the Avengers Assemble cartoon.

- She-Hulk; broke the fourth wall and traveled to K.E.V.I.N.'s reality. She-Hulk has fought Kang as an Avenger.

- Doctor Strange; effed around and found out in Multiverse of Madness, though I don't think he's fought Kang in the comics.

- Ms. Marvel; Kamala got herself involved in a time loop where she saves her grandmother with her bangle. Aside from being teammates with Kang on the Cosmic Avengers, the two were fused by Gamora (using the Soul Stone) into Kamala Kang, with the power to embiggen through time. Because that makes sense. Kang also once stranded Kamala in the early days of the Avengers, and in that same conflict it was revealed by a cosmically empowered future Kamala that the two briefly dated in her 30's and that's why he hates her.

- And now in Quantumania, we have Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In the comics *Nadia* Van Dyne fought Kang during the Kang War in the Avengers comics of 2016. Kamala Khan was also present. Iron Lad actually saved Scott Lang from being killed by Scarlet Witch during the Avengers Disassembled event.

Iron Lad also dated Cassie Lang, and founded the Young Avengers which would later come to include the Multiversal traveler, America Chavez.

The only people to have traveled the Multiverse in the MCU who have never interacted with Kang in the comics (as far as I'm aware) are Cloak &amp; Dagger, as Dagger was sent through 4 alternate realities by the evil Voudon loa (voodoo god) D'Spayre, and both Cloak &amp; Dagger were sent to a 5th alternate reality by the loa Papa Legba.

If Kang Dynasty truly sees the Kangs going after *EVERYONE* who's messed with time/the multiverse (which let's be honest, likely won't happen), we will see the biggest crossover ever seen in Marvel. Because even the comics can only fit so many characters in a panel, and this would encompass far more characters than Endgame."

I think that in the MCU, it was introduced too early. I hipe that Secret Wars will stop this and we'll be able to have new stories (like make the origin of X-Men, with the events of Genosha and House of X/Power of X)"

It did have its fair share of problems, like  \*Medusa's head being shaved after getting to see it used, like, two times.  \*Karnak losing his powers for half the show.  \*Only seeing Black Bolt's powers three times.  \*The whole caste system thing, I would've liked it better if Maximus taking over was just a plain-old coup like in the comics.   \*Weak dialogue/acting in some places.  \* Terrigenesis in Attilan not involving the whole stone husk thing from AoS for some reason and that never being explained.

But I did like  \*Karnak's powers (when we got to see them, it was a pretty interesting concept and looked cool) and character arc.  \*Lockjaw was cute.  \*Anson Mount and Iwan Rheon were pretty solid as Black Bolt and Maximus; liked seeing more of Black Bolt after the 2-ish minutes of screen time he got in MoM).

Morgan stark assumes the mantle of iron lad, and everyone starts getting boners for the mcu again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing i heard from Jonathan majors is that he wants RDJ to appear in Kang dynasty, i dont think that is a coincidence, i think thats a hidden leak. RDJ would not need to have his character come back to life, it can be maybe Morgan going back into her memory to find ways to navigate the time problem in the present. I dont see the fantastic four/Reed richards-Nathan richards story working out at all. 1) i get that in the comics it works different but marvel studios can bend the rules of the comics and 2) no one wants the fantastic four comic accurate story they want Kang to be a descendant of iron man 3) making the fantastic four connection is honestly ludacris considering Kang is already out in the mcu, he will be appearing again and again and that f4 movie doesnt come out until right before the Kang dynasty i believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

they already have all the ingredients. Only a few holy worshippers will complain, this is honestly the only way i see kangs ‚Äúgoing back in time‚Äú invasion working. Everyone wants morgan to be iron lad, it would be the most fitting finish ever.

marvelstudios,Welcome to the Marvel corner! What should I add next?,-
marvelstudios,Tony (And a whole bunch of other problems with the MCU),"Why didn't Tony outfit everyone with Iron Man armor?

Typically, Tony explains away his keeping the armor to himself as a way to keep such a dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong hands. In the MCU, he trusts it only to his best friend Rhodes and wife Pepper.

But with half the universe on the line in *Endgame*, surely the benefit to the mission outweighs the damage the armor could do if it gets into the wrong hands? This is the endgame Tony foresaw, after all. Ultron was a bust, but that doesn't mean s lot of problems can't be solved by throwing lots of Iron Man armor at it.

Poor Natasha and Clint are sent to a mysterious planet in a realm of cosmic death severely underequipped. They're lucky they didn't encounter anything strong enough to kill them but too weak to kill Thanos‚Äìwhich is not a narrow margin.

These are the *Avengers*, made up of people like Steve Rogers that Tony ought to trust implicitly to not misuse the armor. He trusts them with the secret of time travel, in fact; that seems infinitely more dangerous.

On the subject, early on in the film Tony gives Steve the Mk. 50 armor and tells him to put it on if he finds Thanos. It sure seems like that would have been useful, both at the Garden and when going on their time heist. Did Steve forget he had that? He clearly has no qualms with using one of his teammates pieces of gear at a certain point in the film.

Obviously, there are reasons not to turn everyone into Iron Man, and Captain IronThor would have been a bit much. This rant is just nitpicking the internal logic of the film.

...It would have been cool if Steve threw the Mk. 50 onto Thanos to incapacitate him briefly and then blew up the arc reactor, though.

While we're on the subject of sharing tech; if everyone has Ant-Man suits that let them shrink to enter the Quantum Realm, shouldn't everyone have Ant-Man's powers?

One could argue that they do but can't afford to waste Pym Particles using them. But Ant-Man himself doesn't have this problem... except for the one scene where he blows one of the two test-runs by shrinking and growing.

Does Scott's personal Ant-Man armor not use Pym Particles to shrink? Then why not just use that tech for everyone. Even if it can't be reverse-engineered, why does Scott need another Ant-Man suit over his normal Ant-Man suit to travel to the Quantum Realm? He could do that anyway. Does he need it to navigate? If so, given how small the temporal GPS is, wouldn't it have been easier to retrofit that into his existing suit than to make an entirely new one?

How were they able to shrink and unshrink the Milano without Pym Particles?

And, since I'm on a roll here, couldn't the Avengers have sent their A-Team three times sequentially rather than their A-Team, B-Team, and C-Team simultaneously? There's no reason that they need to get all six Stones at once.

Their plan is weird in other ways, too.

Sending the two weakest members of the team after the most mysterious and potentially dangerous Stone. Why not send your two secret agents who used to be part of S.H.I.E.L.D. to New York to secretly extract the Stones that are in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hands, and let Iron Man‚Äìwhose versatility makes him ideal for an unknown planet‚Äìgo on that mission.

Why not send Rocket with him, since he knows space and the Milano the best?

Why not have Thor take the Tesseract from Odin's vault since he's on Asgard anyway and he can just walk right in? On that subject, did Thor know the Infinity Gauntlet there was a fake? If not, why not grab that too?\*

Why send the Hulk to take the Stone from someone whose magic his otherwise valuable strength works be useless against?

Why not send Wong, whose portals would make taking any Stone a cinch?

Why not even *ask* Wong whether or not Doctor Strange is even in New York at the time you're assuming he is?

Why not send a whole team of highly versatile sorcerers?

Why not wait for Captain Marvel to come back to Earth? She's strong, and knows space. And it's not like there's any urgency to this time heist.

Why not send Ant-Man, the professional thief who can shrink out of sight, to steal every Stone?

Why not use time-travel to send a whole team of Ant-Mans?

Why not send Valkyrie, who's stronger than most Avengers and knows space?

Why not put together what Rocket and Asgard know of the Collector and aquire the Aether in the aftermath of *The Guardians of the Galaxy*, while it's undefended?

How does Rocket have an Aether-extractor when Asgard didn't in *Thor: The Dark World*?

Why do Clint and Natasha need the Milano when their time machine is also a space machine? Rhodes and Nebula need to follow Quill, but there doesn't seem an inherent benefit to being in the same reality. Unless they want to approach Vormir carefully because they don't know what's on it.

Why didn't Tony (or anyone) remember the Hulk smashing a stairwell door open and going on a minor rampage?

Why didn't Scott bring up his prospective mother-in-law coming back from the Quantum Realm when Tony suggested his doing so was a fluke?

If Thanos was so close to Morag, why didn't he go after the Power Stone himself, rather than send Ronan, Nebula, and Gamora?

Why did Thanos' ship detect the Power Stone in the first place? It's been sitting there for who knows how long, and he detects it just before Quill shows up?

Where was the Other during *Endgame*? He's not dead yet!

Is Nick Fury still pretending to be dead? If so, he's not doing a very good job at it.

I'm really hoping we see Peter Parker be a cool big bro to Morgan in future films.

What does Mordo think of recent happenings? He can't really blame everything on sorcerers anymore, but he ought to be pissed that Strange did more timey-wimey stuff.

Did Bruce and Natasha still have a thing? He was especially sad about her death but she barely talked to him.

Does Steve know that someone without super-soldier serum can really only use the Captain America shield.... as a shield?

Will Steve now run for president? Look out, Matthew Ellis!

Do you reckon Old Cap was snapped?

Frigga really seemed like Loki at points. She told Thor to leave the sneaking to his brother, that he as a failure, and that he was seeking the council of wisest person on Asgard. We even see Loki when Thor first comes to Asgard. Ah well, I guess Loki really *does* take after his mother.

Hey, remember that time Loki was blue!?

\*It would have been pretty mind-blowing if Odin's Gauntlet was never played off as a fake and instead worked into the plot here as a replacement for Thanos'. I really like what we got, but it would have been sick to get that eight year pay-off from a minor Easter egg.

This really got away from me. I just wanted to write ""Tony is a bit of a dick""."
marvelstudios,Marvel needs to stop its movie-to-sell-toys strategy and raise the tone of the moves to an adult audience.,"I've seen ALL of the MCU content as many of you. And I think the *deus-ex-machina* formula that we got to see in many of the movies is just more than done for all that we've seen from Marvel right now. I understand that it is its way to break blockbusters records which is part of what we as an audience are used to, but I think Marvel needs to start exploring more complex charachter ellaboration (we have had a glimpse on [DS.MOM](https://DS.MOM) with Wanda) so that they reach a more human-like perspective rather than the Hero-Villain-Success formula that we've been having over and over for the past 15 years.

marvelstudios,I miss how frequently we saw the characters early into the MCU. The same characters dominated Phases 1 and 2 and we got to know them very well.,"We saw Iron Man twice in 2008, again in 2010, and again in 2012. That's a lot of screentime with our main hero within 4 years where we really got to know him well. In addition, he had his own film AGAIN the year after Avengers! 

Thor and Captain America debuted and were in the Avengers again within a year. They were each within their own solo films again within 2 years after Avengers. 

The same characters dominated most of Phases 1 and 2. Now, it appears that characters will only get solo films once every three phases or so. We don't know them as well, and there's only more characters being added that have to be tracked by casual audiences. There's a lack of a ""main character"" like Iron Man or even Captain America. I hope that the MCU can establish the connection with some of these vast new characters that audiences had with the early Avengers. Otherwise, seeing them team-up won't hit quite the same."
marvelstudios,I was insanely bored re-watching Loki Season 1,"I still love the show. I love pretty much every MCU project. 

I love Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Owen Wilson is fantastic. 

Sylvie is an interesting character, and the plot is obviously super important to the MCU moving forward. 

But damn, re-watching the show I was bored out of my mind. 

When you watch it for the first time, it's mysterious and engaging. But when you already know what's going to happen, it drags like a Chihuahua trying to pull the lifeless corpse of a bull over a dirt mound. 

So much talking, so much exposition, so much paperwork. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not someone who thinks the MCU is all about action. If anything, I think most recent MCU projects need less action and more human moments.

But Loki Season 1 really, REALLY, needed a couple more great action sequences to help pace things out better. 

I really hope Season 2 isn't the same way.

Did anyone else find Loki Season 1 to be pretty boring on the re-watch?"

marvelstudios,"MCU ""Connective Tissue"" Power Rankings Part 4: 2015 and Phase 2","Hello! For those of you that followed my earlier I am back after a long hiatus. Sorry for the delay. This process was much more intensive than I expected, mostly because seasons of Agents of SHIELD run over the course of two calendar years. Since it's been so long, here's the links to parts [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/y861ig/mcu_connective_tissue_power_rankings_part_1_phase/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/ybve27/mcu_connective_tissue_power_rankings_part_2_2013/), and [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/ycdhsb/mcu_connective_tissue_power_rankings_part_3_2014/)

Anyway, 2015 added A LOT to the MCU, another show on ABC and the first foray into the Netflix shows as well as the continuation of the movies and *Agents of SHIELD*. New characters aren't typically gonna debut on the top 20 anymore because established characters are just that, established, but I still need to track their debut, appearances, etc from the inception in case I feel they deserve to be added down the road. 

1. **Tony Stark / Iron Man** (Previous: 2nd)- Another Avengers movie means another massive role for Tony Stark, and a re-establishing of Stark as the most important character through the first two phases of the MCU.

2. **Agent Phil Coulson** (Previous: 1st)- Phil keeps chugging along on the small screen with *Agents of SHIELD* a show that continues to improve upon it's previous seasons, but he doesn't retain the top spot. Starring in the network TV shows just isn't going to have the same gravitas as starring in the major motion pictures

3. **Nick Fury** (Previous: 3rd)- Fury holds down the third spot with his appearance in *Age of Ultron*. I feel like he has a sizable lead on everyone below him, but we're at the point where his role begins to be a bit diminished. Will be interesting to see where he places moving forward.

4. **Steve Rogers / Captain America** (Previous: 5th)- Four leading roles now makes Stark/Rogers/Thor as the official big three of the MCU.

5. **Thor Odinson** (Previous: 6th)- As before, Thor is below Cap because frankly, his movies are not as good.

6. **Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow** (Previous: 10th)- Natasha has two leading roles and two supporting roles so far, whereas Banner has three leading roles and one cameo. It's close, but I feel the audience has spent more overall time with, and knows Natasha more to this point, so she gets the nod.

7. **Bruce Banner / Hulk** (Previous: 9th)- I think we feel closer to Nat for two reasons. First, Hulks leading roles are mostly Avengers movies aka ensemble films, and the acting change gives us a small sense that the Banner from *The Incredible Hulk* isn't the same guy, as much as we know it is. 

8. **Agent Peggy Carter** (Previous: 14th)- A massive year for Peggy. Starring in her own show, cameos in *Agents of SHIELD*,*Ant-Man* and even *Age of Ultron* in a dream sequence. 2015 is the year of Peggy Carter.

9. **James Rhodes / War Machine** (Previous: 11th)- Rhodey gets a great role in Ultron. Equal parts comedy and action, ending in him joining Cap and Nats New Avengers roster. 

10. **Pepper Potts** (Previous: 4th)- Pepper takes the year off as her importance in the franchise starts to wane as new characters start to take center stage.

11. **Erik Selvig** (Previous: 11th)- Similarly to Pepper, Selvig starts to become obsolete. You can feel it with his role in *Age of Ultron*. It's a role that barely needed to be there, largely left on the cutting room floor.

12. **Maria Hill** (Previous: 15th)- Maria has a smaller scale Peggy Carter kind of year. She played a meaningful role in this years episodes of *Agent of SHIELD* episodes, while also have a contributing role in *Age of Ultron*. Maria acts as the bridge between the big screen and the small screen.

13. **Jasper Sitwell** (Previous: 7th)- Last year was Sitwell's big culminating year, but a subsequent appearance in the Whitehall flashbacks in *Agents of SHIELD* season two keeps him relevant for a little while longer.

14. **Loki Laufeyson** (Previous: 8th)- The long winter of no Loki is rough, especially without a prominent villain to officially replace him yet.

15. **Howard Stark** (Previous: 18th)- Between Dominic Cooper and Trevor Slattery, we just can't quit Howard Stark. A supporting role for Cooper in season one of *Agent Carter* and a cameo in *Ant-Man*, Howard has as many individual appearances as Tony to this point!

16. **Clint Barton / Hawkeye** (Previous 19th)- A huge role for him in *Age of Ultron* is not enough to quite dig Hawkeye out of the basement, but it's a start.

17. **Happy Hogan** (Previous: 12th)- Two years of no Happy. It seems the theme of this part 4 is legacy characters making way for new characters as we see Pepper, Selvig and Happy all fall far in the rankings.

18. **Sam Wilson / Falcon** (Previous: NR)- And here's a perfect example of a rising newbie. Wilson parlayed a breakout role in *Winter Soldier* into a follow-up cameo in *Age of Ultron* and a fun supporting role in *Ant-Man* that in-part helps set up events in next year's *Civil War*. Providing connective tissue and a through line for three years worth of movies, maybe I should have had him higher!

19. **Sif** (Previous: 16th)- Sif probably falls into the category with those previously mentioned Earth characters, but she has another appearance in *Agents of SHIELD* so I'm not going to completely remove her yet. She has four separate appearances in a five year span.

20. **Thanos** (Previous: NR)- I thought about including Daisy Johnson here, but 2015 is the the year that the wool is taking off the Avengers eyes, and it's apparent to them that ""someone is playing an intricate game"" with the Infinity Stones. Thanos' appearances thus far have all been brief, but meaningful, so I felt it his character should be recognized. 

Thanks for reading. I'm gonna get right to work on 2016 so there isn't much time off between posts. The next post is going to add *Captain America: Civil War*, *Doctor Strange* (and future connective GOD Wong), *Agents of SHIELD* 2nd half of season three and 1st half of season four. *Agent Carter* season two, *Daredevil* season two, and **Luke Cage** season one. What an awesome year that was for the MCU! See ya next time!"

marvelstudios,My (possibly) controversial take on how Quantumania should have ended,"---&gt;This post is a re-upload coz my previous post was waiting for approval but two weeks later, it still hasn't made any progress.&lt;---


Quantumania was a mixed bag for me. While I don't think it's the worst MCU (Dark World, Eternals &amp; Love and Thunder come to mind), it was a huge disappointment.

Like the prior Ant-Man films, the Quantumania ends on a relatively upbeat tone, with Kang defeated and Scott and the ant-fam walking away with no harm done, which isn‚Äôt a problem in and of itself since the Ant-Man films have been known for their lighter tones. But if Marvel was to convince us that Kang is an Avengers-level threat for the future, they really needed to change the status quo.

While they're at it, let Scott suffer a loss in some form. Every third film in an MCU semi-franchise before this film has had the hero suffer some form of loss or change. However, nothing changes for Scott, which sucks. Thankfully, there's a change I'd make that I think fixes both of these problems.

For context, many people theorised before the film's release that Scott would die in Quantumania, which would up the stakes and establish Kang's threat level. Looking back, while I don't think they should have killed Scott, I do believe someone needed to die, someone close to Scott.

That's why I think Kang should have killed Cassie.

Controversial take, am I right? I know this would mean we kill the potential of Cassie becoming a member of the Young Avengers whenever they do assemble, but I think it would work. This whole film, Scott has said that he wishes to make up time as Cassie's dad as he was missing during the five years in the Quantum Realm. His whole motive to help Kang was for Cassie's sake. So what better motivation for Scott to rally the Avengers to stop Kang and the Council of Kangs in Kang Dynasty than to have him lose his child at the hands of the Multiverse Saga's big bad?

In practice, I would have Cassie come through the portal to save Scott instead of Hope. It was a pleasant surprise in the moment to see Hope come through the portal, and I also quite liked the embrace they had for each other after defeating Kang. However, looking back, it feels lacking in emotional depth since Hope was pretty much sidelined in Quantumania.

What do you guys think?"

marvelstudios,Question,-
marvelstudios,Favorite Marvel Couples?,"I‚Äôll admit it. My choices are pretty basic since I‚Äôm not familiar with the comics compared to the movies/tv shows. 

-Tony Stark x Pepper Potts: I like that Pepper is the only person who can drop Tony‚Äôs ego a few notches. Their banter was great in the movies and I was very sad when their love story ended in tragedy. 

Scarlet Witch x Vision: It was really interesting to see Wanda- someone with a bunch of trauma and emotional pain- and Vision- a character who grew to feel/understand emotions over time- slowly get together. They had some sweet moments in Infinity War and WandaVision. Like Tony x Pepper, I was sad when Wanda x Vision‚Äôs story ended the way it did. My only complaint is I wish that they had more moments before they got together since the couple felt rushed.

Peter Parker x Mary-Jane Watson: This is a regular friends-to-lovers story and the somewhat normalcy of their feelings makes the couple enjoyable. It‚Äôs a pallets cleanser to all the more crazy romances. 

Rogue x Gambit: This couple was very cute in the 90s X-Men and for X-Men Evolution. From the former, I liked that Rogue had this desire to pursue Gambit but didn‚Äôt because of her fear of hurting him. It adds an element that has me rooting for them."

marvelstudios,How Multiverse of Madness is a love letter to the Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy (SPOILERS),"So we all know the easter eggs Sam Raimi put into Multiverse of Madness - Bruce Campbell and the Classic, his car.  


But what I haven't seen anyone online talk about are the narrative elements and motifs that reflect the Spider-Man trilogy as well, and, in my opinion, paint a love letter to the Spider-Man Trilogy directed by the very same Sam Raimi and composed by the very same Danny Elfman.  


I'll be honest, I binge-watched the Spider-Man trilogy as a kid probably way more than I should so if things feel like a stretch, it's only out of intense familiarity with how that series is shot, structured and written that I draw what to me are obvious parallels. I hope that by the end of this, you'll see the full canvas that each brush stroke makes to paint the full picture. Also if I miss any, feel free to point them out.   


MASSIVE SPOILERS BELOW  


&amp;#x200B;

First things first, we have a wedding Doctor Strange attends - this wedding is of the love of his life to another man, and it hurts him deep inside. This was a major plot point in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy (SRST from now on) as well, with Peter having to watch MJ fall in love with another man who she almost gets married to. 

There's also an upper floor bar that Strange and Christine are talking about how things would never work out between them in, hearkening back to the upper floor bar where Peter watches MJ accept Jameson's son's proposal to her.

Soon after, Strange is looking out of a balcony and notices that something is attacking New York, so he goes to investigate. Surprise surprise, it's a monster. But this monster is rather tentacled and likes to throw cars around, much like a certain other tentacled villain from the SRST. The Cloak of Levitation tries to save America Chavez, but gets trapped under some debris while she gets flung onto a crumbling window ledge, much like Mary Jane in Spider-Man 1's parade scene and Aunt May in Spider-Man 2's bank heist scene. The squid monster climbs up the building, and we cut to interior shots of office workers looking out in fear, again much like Spider-Man 2's bank heist scene.

This is followed by a diner scene, something that appears heavily in the SRST.

When we meet our villain, the Scarlet Witch, we quickly find that obsession with something that on the surface is beneficial has corrupted her, much like Norman Osbourne and Otto Octavius. She is willing to become the villain to protect her children, just like Flint Marko. And she feels robbed of her loved ones, a feeling that leads to hatred, much like Harry Osbourne. Her parallel continues in the mind sequence with Professor X, where she is trapped by a version of herself that is hellbent on achieving her goals, much like Otto and the Arms. And in fact, in the end, it takes being shown the error of her ways for her to come to her senses, where she destroys the instrument of evil, the Darkhold, as well as herself in a building collapse...again, just like Doc Ock.

When Strange and Chavez go dimension hopping, the first thing they land on is a rooftop garden, and the scene lets us know that for now the danger has passed. In Spider-Man 1, after the parade scene Spidey and MJ land on a rooftop garden, and the danger had passed for then too.

Cue obligatory Bruce Campbell scene here, accompanied by New York street food, a Sam Raimi favorite.

The scene where Scarlet Witch takes over the other Wanda focuses on down to earth home life, a motif common to the SRST, and when she gets possessed and has to act normal hearkens back to when Norman would get possessed and have to act normal around others.

Oh, and the whole thing with American not being able to use her powers until she overcomes trauma, trusts herself and stops worrying, just like Spider-Man losing his ability to be Spider-Man because of trauma and worry but then regaining it when its called upon and he knows he's the only one who can wield his powers.

When Strange and American are drugged by Mordo, the visual distortion was very similar to when Peter is sick from the Spider-Bite.

During the fight in Earth-838, one thing I noticed was Scarlet Witch throwing Captain Marvel. She gets flung into a pillar, then collapses on the floor with shattered glass all over. This shot happened a few times in the SRST with Spidey getting thrown against something and then landing with the exact same weight and shot choreography. In fact, much of the film's fight cinematography hearkens back to Spider-Man 1 and 2 in choice of camera angle, shot length and focus. Sadly we didn't get any kind of end swing or dramatic city flythroughs like the SRST but much of the up close action shots were very similar in composition.

Oh, and also in both Professor X's scene in Wanda's mind and in the sewer: the villain jumpscare, something Raimi loved doing in the SRST. Speaking of which, not a SRST motif but back when Scarlet Witch is crawling out of the gong (you're all Marvel fans, you can handle a time jump or two, right?), her movements were a nod to when Sam Raimi directed The Ring. And when she threatens Wong, she coerces him with threatening the lives of the innocent - hostages were something every SRST villain took.

Going back to the present, it's the Incursion dimension, and we see Sam Raimi's car, the Classic, floating around living its best car life.

Not much to say about the rest except one more thing about Scarlet Witch's redemption - there's a moment of humanity between her and the other Wanda, a parting message meant to put her soul at rest, much like Flint Marko or Otto being forgiven by Spider-Man.  


These were all the ones I found, and like I said some of them take familiarity with the Spider-Man trilogy to see parallels, but I hope overall that you can now to some extent agree with me about the film being a love letter to the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. And if not, well I'll just keep hopping universes until I find the you that does. Thanks for reading!  


BONUS!

One last thing I kept noticing were the guitar riffs out of nowhere. While not a SRST motif, it was a nice callback to the guitar riffs in Men in Black 3, also composed by Danny Elfman."

marvelstudios,What if the whole MCU events are just a discussion between Dr Strange and Kang ?,[deleted]
marvelstudios,How can the Marvel retroactively convince the general audience that Kang is a threat after Quantumania?,"I am confident that the Kang in Quantumania is the big bad of the saga. You don‚Äôt make him disappear the way he did and have the council say he is the strongest of them unless there is payoff later.

I understand that he didn‚Äôt have the power of time in the Quantum Realm, but if you aren‚Äôt a big fan like people on this sub, I don‚Äôt think that clicked with the general audience. General discourse is just that ‚ÄúKang can be beat by Ant-Man.‚Äù

So how do y‚Äôall think Marvel turns this around and convinces people he is a greater threat than he is currently perceived? Because currently I‚Äôm concerned they aren‚Äôt going to stick the landing at the end of the saga."
marvelstudios,Why does no one speak up in defense of Wanda being vilified? [CACW],"What I mean is, even before the Accords debate, Wanda was being vilified in the press for the Lagos attack (which is very misplaced blame, because the blame for those deaths lies with the terrorist the Avengers were in the process of attempting to arrest), with the media specifically talking about her, and casting doubt on her trustworthiness.

And yet, it doesn't seem like any of the other Avengers (except for Steve) seems to care about Wanda's predicament. She's getting a lot of bad press. Shouldn't the Avengers be banding together to solve this problem of, ""We shouldn't let the world blame Wanda for something that's not her fault""? ü§®ü§î

Actually, come to think of it, it begs the question: why was PR so non-existent? Given who the Avengers are, you'd think they'd have spokespeople to speak up for them or make statements after what happened in Lagos. ü§î

Imagine if they had a spokesperson to make a statement along the lines of the following: 

&gt;""It is unfortunate that despite the Avengers' successful efforts to stop the terrorist cell led by infamous HYDRA agent Brock Rumlow, casualties resulted. And a dozen people in that office building perished when Rumlow blew himself up. Although some might be inclined to blame these casualties on new Avenger member Wanda Maximoff, as she was in the process of using her powers to move Rumlow away from civilians as he was exploding, the truth is that these casualties are not her fault. They are solely the fault of a madman who decided he was not going let Captain America take him alive, a madman who was a participant two years ago in a plot to mass murder 20 million people. In addition, I would like to add that although there were still fatalities, Miss Maximoff also *saved* the lives of everyone in that marketplace. If it was not for her split second thinking, hundreds more people would be dead. And if the Avengers were not there in Lagos, a group of terrorists would have successfully released a bioweapon into the world, one capable of killing thousands. The Avengers are not responsible for the destruction brought upon by the bad guys that they are attempting to stop, that blame should start and end with the bad guys.""

Let's face it, if they had a spokesperson make a statement along those lines, there probably would be much more public outcry against the Accords. This is because in this scenario, most of the public and possibly most of the would-be signers of the Accords would be acknowledging that all of the death and destruction in Lagos is solely the fault of Rumlow and his accomplices, and that the Avengers managed to prevent a potentially worse terrorist attack in the process."

marvelstudios,"What can we *realistically* expect from Avengers: Secret Wars in terms of its plot, characters, and impact on the MCU after it?","Now, I‚Äôm not a hardcore comic book fan. But I do have a basic understanding of both Secret Wars storylines. I have read tons of speculation and theories, some claiming that Doctor Doom will be the film‚Äôs main villain, the Beyonder will be made into a Kang variant, and that every live action Marvel character will pop up as cameos. Much of what I‚Äôve read on this sub is pretty wild, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm interested in hearing more realistic speculations; speculations that aren‚Äôt fueled by fan expectations on what *should* happen, but rather on what has been setup in Phases 4 and 5 so far.

Here‚Äôs what I think will happen based on what has been established so far‚Ä¶

Since Kang is being set up as the next big bad of the MCU, I think it‚Äôs safe to assume that he‚Äôll be the villain of both Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. He or the heroes will be responsible for creating an incursion that will result in the creation of Battleworld by the end of The Kang Dynasty. Then in Secret Wars, the inhabitants of Battleworld will work together to take down Kang and his council. The ending of the film will usher in some major change in the status quo of the MCU going forward; possibly some sort of reboot with multiple characters from different universes living in one big universe.

I also think we should expect some more cameos, but of actors/characters we‚Äôve seen already. I‚Äôm talking about Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, the villains from No Way Home (possibly?), Hugh Jackman‚Äôs Wolverine, and either Chris Evans as an older Steve Rogers or Robert Downey Jr. as a variant of Tony Stark."

And another huge factor in this is that unlike in the Eternals movie there would have been no one to stop the Emergence from occurring since the only two who knew it was going to happen were Ajak and Icarus and the latter had no intention of stopping it while the former only chose to stop it after seeing how the Avengers were able to bring back half the universe that was lost

So without the Blip Ajak would never have had that change of heart and she would have completed her mission thus the Earth would have been destroyed once Tiamat awakened"
marvelstudios,what do you think are the pitfalls/chances of mutants being introduced into the MCU like this..,"
I know there has been thousands of these threads ever since the Fox deal went through, but in this pitch I hope to explain:

* Why we haven't heard of mutants till now

* How they are introduced

* Why Magneto is still alive and kicking in 2025



Everyone is familiar with the decimation Storyline, where Wanda says ""no more mutants"" and the global population drops to 198, but those that don't read comics may not have heard about the genocide in Genosha. 

For context Genosha is an island country that was a mutant apartheid state, later turned mutant haven by Magneto, home to millions. Basically the entire population gets wiped out in the space of an hour by the new X-Men big bad sending every sentinel on the planet. [Morrisons New X-Men run]


**My Pitch**

So my pitch is what if Genosha was home to basically *ALL* mutants at the time of the Genocide.

Prior to the genocide, mutant bigotry is just like it is in the comics, protests, hate groups, Sentinels, all of it. Have the event happen at least a decade before Iron Man one (2008), which is why mutants/Sentinels/Genosha is never mentioned.

There were no survivors found, the world thinks mutants are wiped out, the sentinel programs was decommissioned, etc. The world as a whole took a look at itself and was simultaneously shocked/ashamed with itself that mutant bigotry had gone that far. Everything was kinda swept under the rug in a 'lets just never talk about that..' kinda way. 

I would also merge the effect of halting mutant births world-wide (from decimation) into the genocide event. Maybe the Sentinels released a virus into the atmosphere or something idk. 

However: 

* Magneto survives, he's only able to save himself. this becomes the 'holocaust' his character is rooted too (still Jewish just born long after WWII). 


* Some other powerful mutants survive, Xavier, Emma, Obscure mutants not on Genosha (like Selene, Apocalypse etc) but basically everyone is in hiding till the MCU X-Men launch. 


* 25 yrs later, Xavier has made a team. Mutants are resurfacing because of a mysterious new birth (Hope) and basically run with a version of Messiah Complex.

**This explains**

* Where mutants have been all this time, in hiding (understandably) from a world that genocides them. 

* Magnetos rage - was present for the genocide. He understandably takes a hardline stance. You could have him already be a mutant leader in Genosha or a teen then, whatever fits the story.

* All mutant prehistory (from the comics) is available because it happened prior to Genosha. ie Apocalypse etc

* Having the Genocide be preamble to the MCU mutant debut, highlights the ever looming threat that bigotry plays on mutant life. But also raises and clarifies all the WTF questions about how can the world hate mutants but love superheroes. Its directly paralleled by real world questions like Palestine, anti-Semitism, war etc (things we see the horrific fallout for daily, but somehow still exist). 

So what are your thoughts?

Does changing Magnetos origin from real life holocaust survivor to fictional holocaust survivor diminish his character? 

Does the absence and re-emergance plausibly explain the mutants notable absence in the MCU along with where the 'mutant bigotry' will come from?

Isaiah's actions during the Korean War took place when S.H.I.E.L.D. was in it's infancy, so Peggy wasn't Director yet but the organization would've been relatively small so it's likely she was still an exceptionally well-informed agent. If she didn't know anything though... it's possible information on the subject was systematically kept from her due to her personal involvement with Steve. That said, when Carter does become Director it would've be hard to keep much from her, especially concerning the Super Soldier Serum. There is of course the Hyrda infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. variable too.   


So, basically, I'd like some outside input because I've got nothin'"

marvelstudios,how I would've fixed thor love and thunder,"sum lite

1. give Gorr more screen time (show the butchering) and a deeper storyline 
2. cut out like half of the corny jokes 
3. I wouldn't have involved the kids being kidnapped, it didn't add much to the stakes and made it more sillier. 
4. enhance the fight scene...one thing I hated about this film is how dull the fight scenes were...especially after coming from a movie w great fight scenes like ragnarok. 
5. I'd introduce beta ray bill at the end  
6. don't kill Jane off and give her a better storyline 
7. make zeus more serious, not too serious but c'mon we saw Zeus in DC and Wakiti decided to give this zeus a clumsy skirt. 
8. finally I would've had Gorr's encounter with Eternity play a role w Loki and Kang"

marvelstudios,Antman 2nd viewing hot take. Kang sucks.,"I know right, but hear me out real quick. So I first saw this opening day and really dug it. I would have liked more levity given the previous Antman films and the wacky nature of the Quantum realm but I enjoyed it anyway. 

Just took my son, who has been asking to see it, and I gotta say Kang pretty much kills the entire movie. 

The Quantum Realm is really cool and the people and creatures that live there and their interactions with the Ant Family is all super fun and interesting. These were my favorite parts and I could visible see my Son‚Äôs excitement and wonder during the first half of the film.

Then Kang shows up and sucks all the fun out of the movie. All the cool Quantum Realm stuff stops and we just get this dead serious and by comparison bland villain. Kang has no motivation beside ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù and he has no interesting story to him besides ‚ÄúBad Guy who does Bad Things‚Äù Majors is really freaking cool as Kang but to give us THIS Kang inside THIS film is a huge tonal clash. 

15 minutes or so after Kang shows up I can see my Son getting bored and in all honesty so was I. I didn‚Äôt realize the first time how utterly boring Kang is on this. I was so excited for his appearance the first time that I guess I didn‚Äôt notice but watching it again I noticed how much fun everything is in this movie except for Kang. The excitement came back for my son when all the Quantum characters showed up again for the final battle.

Anyway, Majors is great as Kang but Kang is lame as shit in Quantimania."
marvelstudios,What character had you like this?,-
marvelstudios,How do you think Dr.Strange will react when he sees his universes Fantastic Four?,-
marvelstudios,What do you think the future of the MCU will look like?,"Okay, I know this is quite a vague question and it's impossible to *know* for a fact what the future holds, but I just can't help but wonder what the next few years of the MCU are going to be like. So much has happened since 'WandaVision' and I think it's fair to say that the MCU is currently in the worst place it's ever been in. Whether you have personally enjoyed the content or not, it's impossible to deny that things are a mess right now. Negative discourse is at an all-time high and it's becoming harder to avoid the storm that's brewing. A lot of people aren't happy.

I think there's a lot of different factors to consider when speculating about what the future holds for this franchise. Some that stand out to me are:

* Phases 4 and 5 having the MCU's worst recevied films to date and the box office numbers declining at a concerning rate
* James Gunn starting up his DCU, which means the MCU is going to have some serious competition
* Marvel realising there's a problem and abruptly delaying most of their future releases, with only 2 shows and 3 films being released this year
* The VFX industry being very vocal about how Marvel has been mistreating them and that it can't keep going on like this
* People losing interest due to the recent decline in quality and the confusing Multiverse storyline
* Bob Iger returning to Disney and wanting to focus on quality instead of just churning out as much content as possible

So, with all of this in mind, what do you think the future holds for the MCU? Will they get things back on track or is it too late for them to fix their reputation? 

*I know this is a Marvel subreddit but try and look at it from more of an objective point of view. I'm not asking if you personally enjoyed Phases 4 and 5 (so far). I'm asking what you think the future of this franchise will be like.*"
marvelstudios,How I would do... that guy.... in Ant-Man 3,"I think it's weird that MODOK just... wasn't MODOK? He's an entirely different character with MODOK's proportions and pretty much none of his personality. I think it's a waste of a cool premise.

It's a pretty sci-fy-y concept that isn't very realistic but whatever: I wish his head being enlarged gave him the potential to be a genius. Since he's such a unique specimen, his body was used to make a kind of bio-mechanical supercomputer and his mind was wiped.

He becomes a mindless robotic slave that only serves Kang, but a bit of his original personality manages to break through and then he becomes sort of a conglomeration of Darren Cross and the robotic MODOK. He has all of Darren's ambition, but the genius of MODOK. He escapes the quantum realm and takes over AIM.

That's way closer to his actual character than ""well being shrunken made him kinda look like MODOK so let's just put him in MODOK's armor and just make him a regular guy lol"" 

pls dont let this get screenshotted and posted on a ""marvel fans being dumb"" gimmick acc on twitter i didnt do anything wrong be nice to me pls pls pls"
marvelstudios,Is the Sacred Timeline a loop?,"As we see in Loki Season 1, The Sacred Timeline is physically seen as a circle. Does that mean that every reality within the Sacred Timeline is in a loop? How does that work? Do they talk about it in the show?

We know the Sacred Timeline was formed of a bunch of realities with small differences to each other, and all happening at different points in time, so what happens when one of those realities hits the ""end"" of the Timeline?"

marvelstudios,What‚Äôs your PHILOSOPHICAL hot take on the MCU?,"One thing I appreciate about the MCU as a giant art project is that, whether they succeed or fail at it, is that they try to prioritize story over spectacle. 

WandaVision is about grief. FalconandtheWinterSoldier is about trauma. NoWayHome is about brothers. MoonKnight is about identity. Loki is about self love‚Ä¶

Just beautiful story beats that I love because they reflect real life.

The Eternals‚Äô struggle against the control of their god, like a family leaving a cult. Peter and Osborne played heavily on a family member dealing with dementia and losing their identity. SheHulk taking control of her own life story. Wakanda and having a tight knit group and family lose their leader.

These range from StarLord dealing badly with breakups to Tony vs Thanos representing Man dealing with the Death impulse. 

Whats your ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù takes on the MCU?

Mine are:

1 Kang is SUPPOSED to be a joke. He‚Äôs got the tech, but deep down, he‚Äôs still the Wizard of Oz. (kind of a joke / kind of a fake.)

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a serious man.‚Äù In the words of Sylvie. Which is why he has to lose.

2 That we‚Äôre all overlooking the Baby Gamora that Thanos listened to. Who the fuck is she? What the fuck is she? She‚Äôs a grotesque cosmic horror y‚Äôall, I guarantee it. Like in SUSPIRIA if you‚Äôve watched that movie."

marvelstudios,What I think the MCU‚Äôs biggest problem is.,"Let me skip the ‚Äúmarvel is falling off‚Äù bs and get straight to the point. I think mcu movies are too focused on expanding the universe rather than telling stories about their characters. 

The best MCU movies have always been about how someone can overcome their flaws to become a hero. You see an arrogant war-profiteer become someone who cares about the kind of impact they have on the world in Iron Man. You see a weak man who‚Äôs constantly stepped on become one of the bravest and selfless leaders the world has ever seen in cap 1. Even  an event movie like Infinity War focuses on Thanos and what he‚Äôs willing to sacrifice for what he genuinely believes is a good deed. The characters always came first.

I think the biggest offenders of set up &gt; character are Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. Strange and Scott do have arcs in those movies, but it feels like setting up the next saga is more of a priority. MoM has to explain the multiverse, variants, incursions, and magic books. Wanda and her kids also take up a good amount of story which overall leaves us with little time to dissect Strange as a person. Quantumania was even explicitly marketed as an avengers setup movie and scott has to react to kang and the quantum realm rather than having a personal, weighted conflict.

It‚Äôs not to say those are the only movies coming out now. I think projects like Wakanda Forever and Falcon and the Winter Soldier do a great job of growing their characters and not having too much emphasis on whats next for marvel. I just think marvel forgot what made them so successful in the first place and needs to calm down on ‚ÄúGET READY FOR SECRET WARS!‚Äù

What do you guys think?"

I really loved *No Way Home*, *Shang-Chi*, *Wakanda Forever*, *Loki*, *WandaVision*, *Multiverse of Madness*, *Ms. Marvel* and the D+ Specials (*Werewolf by Night and the *GoTG Holiday Special*)

I had lots of fun with *TFatWS*, *Black Widow*, *What If*, *She-Hulk* and *Love and Thunder* and i think *Eternals* is a beautiful movie. I didn't love *Moon Knight* and *Hawkeye* as much as some people did, but i definitely had a great time watching them.

I'm really into the Multiverse storyline with Kang, Loki, and all those characters (probably because i really like these time travel/multiverse paradoxes and stuff), and the grounded storyline with Captain America, Val and the Thunderbolts.

So yea, i'm glad to be happy with the current state of the MCU and i'll always try to keep spreading positivity about it. Just a reminder that no one has to keep watching something something they're not enjoying!"

marvelstudios,You are transported back in time to the early 2000s with the rights of every Marvel character. What does your version of the MCU look like?,"Who are your ""big three"" characters? What characters and teams get introduced, and which ones get skipped over? Here are my ideas:

Phase One (6 films)

Spider-Man: The first Spider-Man movie is basically an amalgamation of all three first Spider-Man movies. Vulture and Shocker are the villains, Gwen and Harry are the friends, and Norman is introduced, but not as the Goblin.

Iron Man: This is pretty much just MCU Iron Man 1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Black Panther: Black Panther gets a trilogy instead of Captain America in my version. His first film is an origin story with Klaw as the main villain.

Captain America and the Wolverine: Takes a lot of the same beats from The First Avenger, but with Wolverine as a secondary protagonist and Sabretooth as a secondary antagonist.

The Avengers: My version of Avengers looks quite a bit different. Janet van Dyne is introduced as Wasp, Hank Pym is introduced as Goliath, and Ultron is the main villain (designed by Pym to be a ""better"" Iron Man). Iron, Man, Black Panther, and Captain America are a part of the team, and Spider-Man becomes an ally temporarily. Pym dies at the end, and Ultron escapes into the internet.

Fantastic Four: The (original) origin story for the Fantastic Four. Introduces a lot of cosmic elements to the franchise, such as the Infinity Stones and the Power Cosmic. Silver Surfer is the villain, and Galactus is hinted at.

Phase Two (6 films)

Spider-Man 2: Scorpion and Rhino are the villains, and both are funded by Oscorp. More hints at the Green Goblin.

Iron Man: Armor Wars: Similar to MCU Iron Man 2, but serves as more of an event film instead of doing a bunch of setup. Justin Hammer and Whiplash are the villains, Ultron reappears and Vision is introduced, Wasp has a role, and Rhodes suits up as War Machine. Basically a big techy crossover.

Black Panther: Call of the Storm: Deals with a lot of in-fighting between the tribes of Wakanda. M'Baku is more villainous than his MCU version. Storm is introduced and Killmonger is the main villain, but he does not die. Doom is teased.

X-Men: My X-Men lineup is Professor X, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Colossus, Angel, and Iceman. Magneto is the villain. Iceman dies.

Avengers: Gods of Asgard: After Loki hijacks the throne of Asgard and banishes Thor to Midgard, the Nine Realms are thrown into chaos. The Avengers (Iron Man, Black Panther, Captain America, Wasp, War Machine, and Vision) must find a way to reactivate the Bifrost and return Thor home. Also introduces Bruce Banner, who is teased as the Hulk.

Fantastic Four: Doomwar: Reed Richarda is thrown into a conflict with his old rival, Victor Von Doom, the leader of the country of Latveria. The end of the film has Doom victorious and the Fantastic Four trapped in the Negative Zone.

Phase Three (10 films)

Spider-Man 3: Spider-Man vs. Green Goblin. Gwen Stacy dies. Teases Mary Jane and a future trilogy for Spider-Man.

Avengers vs. X-Men: What happens instead of Captain America: Civil War. The damage caused by a new, unknown team of supers (the X-Men) forces the government to step in and take action. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are introduced with major roles. At the end, Magneto forms the Brotherhood of Mutants with Quicksilver, Angel, Rogue, and Mystique.

Iron Man: Cosmic Cube: Iron Man, War Machine, Rescue, and Ironheart vs. The Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom. Teases Shang-Chi.

Daredevil: A nice, disconnected, street-level story that introduces Daredevil, Elektra, and Kingpin.

Captain America and the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Introduces S.H.I.E.L.D. and several of its agents, including Nick Fury, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, who become members of the Avengers moving forward.

Doctor Strange: Very similar to the MCU's version.

Avengers: Infinity War: The Avengers and the X-Men must band together to stop Thanos from assembling the Infinity Gauntlet and wiping out half of the population. When the dust settles, the only survivors are Iron Man (stranded in space), Black Panther, Wasp, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, Wolverine, Cyclops, and Spider-Man (who doesn't participate in the Infinity War due to his grief over Gwen's death).

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever: T'Challa must defend Wakanda from Latveria and Talokan following Thanos' snap. Shuri suits up as another Black Panther, and the Midnight Angels are introduced.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Following Thanos' snap, a rag-tag group of heroes must save the galaxy from the looming threat of Galactus and his new herald, Annhilus (aka Ultron). At the end of the film, the Guardians rescue a stranded Iron Man, setting up our final film of this alternate saga:

Fantastic Four: Infinity Gauntlet: After Wakanda defeats Latveria, T'Challa rescues the Fantastic Four from the Negative Zone. Due to the N-Zone's otherworldly properties, the F4 survived the Snap. The remaining heroes must travel through time and space to undo the Snap and save the universe. Iron Man still sacrifices himself, and Doom is set up as the villain of the next saga.

marvelstudios,MCU Multiverse Explained,"This is my view of how the Multiverse and Time Travel and Dimensions and stuff like that works in the MCU. Info could be wrong because, as Doctor Strange said: *""The Multiverse is a concept in which we know frighteningly little""*. English is not my first language so sorry for any errors, but here it is:

#Multiversal War

There was a scientist in the 31st Century named Nathaniel Richards, who found out about the Multiverse and created tech advanced enough to communicate and travel to other realities. His variants soon made the same discovery, and for a while, there was peace. Until, some variants started wanting to conquer the others, and so a ***Multiversal War*** begun.

A variant later know as ***He Who Remains*** used the power of ***Alioth***, a creature born from the rips in reality, to end the War.
He isolated a group of realities and called them the Sacred Timeline, and created the ***Time Variance Authority***, to watch over the Sacred Timeline and and prevent any new realities from being created, therefore preventing any new variants of Nathaniel Richards to be born, therefore preventing another Multiversal War.

#Nexus Events

Imagine the Sacred Timeline being formed of a bunch of very similar realities that exist very close to each other. One reality where you chose to wear a black shirt insead of a green one today. One where you use a different hair style. One where you go to your friend and say: Hey, how are you doing? While in another, you say ""Hi, Good Morning!"". They all follow the same path, with minor and almost irrelevant changes to each other.

(Also, keep in mind that some realities can happen at different time periods at the same time.
Imagine in this reality it's 2023, while in another reality, they're still in 2019. Another one where it's already 2040. All still following the same path, just at different points in time.)

A ***Nexus Event*** happens, when something diverges way too much from the ""Sacred Timeline's path"".
An example: imagine there's a reality where Thor and Loki are kids and are playing around, Thor scares Loki, they laugh and everything keeps going just the way its supposed to.
Imagine another reality where Thor scares Loki in a different way. Still fun, they both still laugh and everything still happens the same.
Now imagine this one, where, instead of laughing after Thor scares him, Loki stabs Thor, which ends up killing him. Thor dying like this is not supposed to happen, and it will cause major differences in this timeline in the future. Kid Loki killing Kid Thor is the Nexus Event of this reality. This is where the TVA comes in, prunes the timeline, and makes everything keep following the Sacred Timeline path.

Nexus Events can also happen using Time Travel. If someone goes back to the past and changes something, it's, in a way, ""changing the predetermined path of the timeline, and thus causes it to branch off.

#Multiverse Reborn

A Loki variants known as Sylvie (yes, she was born a woman, which is one of those ""minor differences"" between realities in the Sacred Timeline. Loki being a woman won't affect any relevant event in the timeline) was playing with Valkyrie toys as a kid, which would inspire her to be a hero in the future instead of the villain she's supposed to be in the future. That caused a Nexus Event, and that's when she was arrested by the TVA.

Sylvie ended up escaping and hiding through out the timeline, until she got help from another Loki variant, and they both went to He Who Remains' Cidadel at the End of Time, where he watches over the timeline since the Multiversal War.

Sylvie then killed He Who Remains, allowing the Sacred Timeline to branch off without the TVA's interference, and thus allowing the Multiverse to be free again.

When the Multiverse was reborn, Nathaniel Richards' variants where also, once again, allowed to exist. They all met again and formed the ***Council of Kangs***, to talk and study about the Multiverse. A variant known as *Kang the Conqueror* was seen as a threat by the Council, and then was exiled to the Quantum Realm of Earth-616, aka the main MCU Timeline. He was later defeated by Ant-Man and the Wasp, which causes the Council to become worried about the people of the timeline starting messing with the Multiverse.

#Multiversal Travel

There are a few (but not many) ways of Multiversal Travel in the MCU

*Nathaniel Richards' Tech* - that being TVA tech, or Kang's Time Chair.

*Multiversal Beings* - such as America Chavez or Uatu the Watcher, who have the natural power of multiversal travel.

*Spells* - such as Dreamwalking, a Darkhold spell that allows you to ""possess"" a variant of yourself. Some spells such as the Runes of Kof-Kol, if not casted correctly, can also cause the displacement of being through out the Multiverse.

Keep in mind that methods such as Dreamwalking keep two realities in a constant connection, and could cause an ***Incursion*** (the two universes being attracted to each other and colliding).

#OBS

So there's a lot of confusion regarding the Multiverse, so these are my thoughts about it:

-I do believe Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man universes are the branch of a branch of a branch of a branch of the Sacred Timeline. I don't think it would make sense for a whole other ""Sacred Timeline"" exist when you can always track something back to a same event or similar aspect. Plus, we have visual clue that a branched timeline can still keep branching, so it's very likely that's the case.

-It's somewhat popular knowlage that Nexus Events ""only happen when it creates a Kang variant"", but i don't think people understand what the writers meant. Yes the TVA and HWR are trying to prevent Kang variants from existing, but that's not what causes the Nexus Event itself. I guarantee you that Alligator Loki eating a cat wouldn't cause a Kang variant being born a thousand years in the future. Or, idk, Sylvie throwing reset charges in random points of the timeline. Yes, Kang variants are their main worry, but Nexus Events aren't caused because of it.

marvelstudios,Superhero movies turning into westerns,-
marvelstudios,What's with the hate for Quantumania?,"I recently saw Quantumania and was worried going in due to the reviews and complaints I'd seen here and elsewhere. I came out totally the opposite, absolutely loved the film.

I usually don't care about others' opinion of something I enjoyed (what's the point of I enjoyed it, that's all that matters) but for this one I found it a real head scratcher, as I honestly couldn't apply any of the criticisms I'd seen to the film, at least to the extent I had seen criticisms being made. I can for sure see that it was perhaps the wrong vehicle to introduce Kang, but was otherwise a solid fun time. Definitely not the dregs of Marvel as some have been making out. I would even go so far as to say I enjoyed it more than Wakanda Forever, though they are of course far from equal in quality.

So what's with the hate? I do think it's fair to call it hate as well, I've seen nothing but bad things about it. Can it just be chalked up to fatigue, or is there really something I've missed (that's obviously entirely possible, I'm no film critic!)?"

marvelstudios,MCU fans who didn't read marvel comics! What do you think about MCU movies?,"I'm Korean, and I'm living in South Korea. Now Marvel Comics are popular in South Korea, but before Nick Fury comes out at Iron man, many Korean didn't know what is Marvel or what is DC. Very very very few of them published in Korea, so naturally Many Koreans started to like it through movies rather than books, including me.

But after the succeess of MCU films, they published a lot of comics, and some Korean read it and others didn't. Me? I read some of them... but personally... they are not my style.

And after they published, if someone say ""No way! They changed characters arc! It's so different!."" then my thoughts always be like ""Really? But... I like this version. So... can you just think this as a different version?"" I thought same things when Harry Potter movies or Lord of the Rings came out.

But I don't think people like me who haven't read the original will feel the same way as I do. So... what's your thoughts on MCU films?"

NOT a critic! Every reference to a TV show or movie's reception l that I've seen lately has been focused on the critics rating and ignores the fans rating. And, personally, no matter what movie/show we mention, I have NEVER taken a critics review into consideration when deciding whether or not to watch it.

Title: Ant-Man: QuantumMania is a Disappointing Direction for the MCU

Post:

I have to say, I'm really disappointed with the direction that Marvel seems to be taking with the upcoming movie Ant-Man: QuantumMania. Don't get me wrong, I've loved the previous Ant-Man films, but this just seems like a step too far.

For those who don't know, the movie is set to explore the concept of the multiverse, with characters from different dimensions colliding and interacting. While this might sound exciting on paper, I can't help but feel like it's just a cheap way to shoehorn in new characters and plotlines without any real substance.

One of the great things about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has been the carefully crafted, interconnected storyline that has been built up over the past decade. But with the introduction of the multiverse, it seems like that cohesive narrative is being thrown out the window.

Not only that, but the whole concept of the multiverse just seems like a lazy way to bring back old characters and recycle old storylines. We've already seen this with the return of J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man: Far From Home, and I fear that Ant-Man: QuantumMania will continue this trend.

Moreover, the first Ant-Man movie was a refreshing change of pace from the typical superhero fare, with its heist plot and clever use of shrinking technology. But with QuantumMania, it seems like the focus is shifting away from what made the character and his films unique, and instead trying to cram in as much fan service as possible.

In short, I'm worried that Ant-Man: QuantumMania is going to be a mess of convoluted plotlines and empty fan service. I hope that Marvel can prove me wrong, but at this point, I'm not holding my breath."

marvelstudios,Why didn't Hank and Janet shrunk the missle?,"As we see in Quantumania, Janet did have those discs during her time in the Quantum Realm. I was confused by why she didn't use them on herself (like Scott), but i figured that level of the Quantum Realm was deep enough and kinda its own pocket dimension for that not to work.

What i'm still confused is: since we know they already had those discs in the 80's, why didn't Hank and Janet use them on the missle instead of shrinking down to destroy it?"
marvelstudios,I had an AI writes things that Ultron would say,-
marvelstudios,Kang theory,"So after re-watching Loki and Quantumania I have a theory about Kang and ‚ÄúHe Who Remains‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt it true that he who remains destroyed EVERY other timeline but the ‚Äúsacred timeline‚Äù? If that is the case, the council of Kang, as well as the conqueror in the quantum realm couldn‚Äôt have existed at the same time as he who remains. Which begs the question, how does Janet meet him in the quantum realm thirty years earlier?

So here‚Äôs my theory - he who remains IS the conqueror we see in the quantum realm, but the version of him that was successful in ‚Äúburning his enemies out of time‚Äù. They have the same facial scars, which the end credits scene shows not all of them do. They repeat almost the exact same monologue when saying ‚Äúyou should fear what‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶.me‚Äù.

My theory is that he who remains dying allowed all other Kangs to exist (we know this) and since time isn‚Äôt linear, and all events are happening simultaneously, the conqueror being exiled to the quantum realm could happen at any point, bc time can flow in any direction in the quantum realm as shown in Avengers: Endgame. 

(SPOILER)
My guess is that somehow the end scene when Scott smashes the core with both grow and shrink devices, it somehow sent him to Alioth, and that will lead us into his eventual resurrection as ‚Äúhe who remains‚Äù."
marvelstudios,"I found this on Youtube, credit goes to EDITS BY ZERO",-
marvelstudios,The Multiverse Saga needs more Crossovers and Less Cameos,"To start let me differentiate Crossovers from Cameos. A cameo is a short/brief appearence by a character in another project (Captain America's role in the Dark World, Wong in Spider-Man: No Way Home). A crossover is a longer appearence of a character in a project where their presence is felt and affects the plot (Black Widow's role in Winter Soldier).

One of my favorite things about the Infinity Saga was the crossovers. Falcon meeting Ant-Man before Civil War and setting up Scott's involvment in the airport fight, Hulk being in Sakaar and meeting up with Thor, Natasha and Steve's friendship in Winter Soldier, Civil War itself, Tony's presence in Spider-Man: Homecoming, etc.

What I also loved about these was:

* The fact that you were giving screentime to characters who weren't going to have their own movie (meaning you didn't have to wait until Age of Ultron to premiere to see Black Widow again or having to wait until Infinity War to find out where the Hulk went).
* The world felt more interconnected
* It allowed you to develop their characters outside of their own project

Cameos like Bruce Banner at the end of Iron Man 3 and Winter Soldier at the end of Black Panther did nothing other than being fan-pleasing surprises with no large impact in the overall story.

With the Multiverse Saga introducing countless new heroes and characters, I feel like Phase 5 and 6 really need to bridge the gap and feature more crossovers. Phase 4 featured a bit of both. As far as cameos we have Sif in Loki, War Machine in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Captain Marvel and Hulk in Shang-Chi. As far as crossovers we have Yelena in Hawkeye, Kang in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Daredevil in She-Hulk, Doctor Strange in No Way Home and Scarlet Witch in Multiverse of Madness. These were great and I really hope future entries feature more crossovers and less cameos. Aside from what I mentioned above, I feel like it saves some screentime in future movies for introductions (imagine if Falcon and Shang-Chi never interact and then they have to team up in Kang Dynasty or the new leader of the Avengers isn't aware of Kang by the time we get to Kang Dynasty). I have a problem with the introduction of new characters because it's taking away screentime from other introduced characters and will make Kang Dynasty a really crowded movie when it doesn't need to be.

I know what some of you might say that the pandemic probably caused some restraints on actors and that's why there weren't more crossovers and that if Phase 4 is going the same route as Phase 1 than it wasn't supposed to feature crossovers until later entries and I agree with you there. So I just hope projects like Captain America: New World Order, Secret Invasion, Shang-Chi 2, Armor Wars, Thunderbolts and maybe even Eternals 2 feature some crossovers instead of introducing new heroes and only have existing heroes pop-up as cameos to tease an upcoming project. I'm really hoping Sam meets the new heroes, Kate or Hawkeye pop-up in Thunderbolts because of Yelena, Armor Wars features an Avengers level team with already existing characters, etc."

Spider-Man. Doctor Strange‚Äôs spell at the end of No Way Home worked so well, that he made Kang forget who Spider-Man really is. This will make him an important key to the plan against him. 

Bonus points: America Chavez might slip by his notice as she is the only America Chavez in any universe. Also, Kamala and Shang-Chi might be somewhat protected from him due to their weapons (rings and bangles)."

marvelstudios,What is all this hate going on with Marvel recently?,"Seriously, I have never seen a movie being criticized this much since Thor Love and Thunder (where the criticism was understandable) but Quantumania isn't even that bad (I really enjoyed watching it) so why are people making it out to be a big deal? I get that it has some flaws like the ending being changed last month, everyone surviving and making Kang seem less of a threat and Modok being a joke. Doesn't anyone think there might be a reason behind keeping everyone alive and making it seem like Kang is dead? The movie ends with Scott having thoughts on whether or not he really defeated Kang. Doesn't anyone think there might be a reason behind all of that happening? Nobody's thinking about it because they are all just focused on spreading negativity about the movie and Marvel in general. Look at the critics, they are all tired of Marvel's new content and are giving negative reviews to Quantumania for no valid reason making the movie seem worse than Thor Love and Thunder when it really isn't.

I have been a Marvel fan since 2018 and never have I ever seen this much criticism towards their movies especially ones that aren't even that bad. Things weren't always like this. Nobody expected an Endgame-level movie every single time Marvel released one of their movies. They all expected a good enjoyable superhero movie. There were flaws in those Marvel movies as well that were released before Endgame and not many people talked about them because the stories they were telling were great and enjoyable unlike now where everyone is finding reasons to spread negativity on a Marvel movie that isn't even that bad. Some of those reasons might be valid but it's not like it's the worst thing they have ever seen which they are definitely making it out to be. One of those valid reasons is Marvel choosing Quantity over Quality which is probably now going to change since Bob Iger is back and Marvel already delayed The Marvels to November of this year. Some people are also worried about the next Avengers movies since some of the writers are the same as Quantumania and Multiverse of Madness. I just feel they're judging too quickly. Those movies are like 2-3 years away and anything could happen. We could either be super disappointed or everyone will insanely be shocked."

marvelstudios,This version of Kang was as strong as he needed to be.,"I've seen news articles about ""Ant Man suffers the worst two-week drop off"" and ""Marvel fumbles the introduction of The Next Big Bad"", and crap like ""Ant Man's appeal has always been that they're small palette cleansing adventures in between the big hero movies"".

And it's all bullshit.
Quantumania suffered from reviews by (yup, stereotypes) basement-dwelling mouth-breathers who live their entire lives deconstructing Marvel movies by watching them 150 times frame-by-frame and complaining about CGI and story-vs-comic adaption when they never actually read the comics. 

Or if they did, they weren't even born when the comics were published and they read them twenty years after they came out. They're judging them by today's standards and they have no idea how awesome they were for kids my age when they originally came out.

Quantumania was fun. It was fine. I really enjoyed it. 
Yeah, M.O.D.O.K. was a little silly, and they messed with his character. But M.O.D.O.K. has always been a silly villain, and I thought he was used remarkably well. Even with the Yellowjacket origin. It was fun. As it was intended to be.

People have been complaining ""Ant Man has always been about small stories"" and that cracks me up because IT WAS.

The entire movie happened on the quantum scale. None of it happened in the ""real world"" and none of it happened to anyone but Lang and his family. Yeah, they stopped Kang. But a Kang that was the weakest of the variants. If he wasn't, he would never have gotten banished to the quantum realm.

This version of Kang was exactly as strong as he needed to be if he was going to put up a fight with (arguably) one of the weakest Avengers and still put on a good show and a struggle for the hero of the movie.

I thought it was a great introduction. Especially when you figure in the Council of Kangs and the implications of all the screwed up timelines that are coming. 

Figuring in the Kang varients we glimpsed, he's way more terrifying than Thanos could have ever been.

So if you read this all the way through my rant, ignore the stupid news articles and crappy reviews.
Quantumania was exactly what the next phase needed it to be. It's the start of a new arc. It introduced the new Big Bad. And it made Ant Man more heroic than I thought he ever could be.

I loved it."

marvelstudios,So why did y‚Äôall hate the Hawkeye series so much again?,"So I‚Äôm watching the show for the first time right now and I really don‚Äôt understand why this got so much hate. It‚Äôs a show that follows a tired, aged, physically and mentally scarred Avenger on one more thrilling adventure as he passes the mantle down to the next generation. 

Throughout the series, we‚Äôre given even more depth into how damaged Clint has been from the action-packed life he has lived and how this has caught up to him in various ways. For instance, his hearing loss due to the many explosions he has survived, his PTSD from the various fights and wars he has fought in, and the guilt he carries for the actions he committed as Ronin and failing to stop Natasha from sacrificing herself. 

His dynamic with Kate is great because her extroverted nature gradually pushes Hawkeye to open up about his feelings towards his past and who he is as a person (which is significant, because he was always very introverted). Unlike most of his other teammates who are well known and glorified by the media, Hawkeye was a person who really could not stand with them in the spotlight due to his missions often requiring him to actually kill his targets. 

Overall, Hawkeye doesn‚Äôt even really consider himself to be a truly good person, much less a hero, and seeing this internal struggle illustrated in the show results in massive depth in a Marvel character that I find to be profound. 

I remember some viewers shitting on the show complaining that Clint is such a ‚Äúboring‚Äù character cause he isn‚Äôt talkative like the other heroes, meanwhile y‚Äôall are whining that your tired of Tony Stark rip-offs who are outspoken and joking all the time.

Then I remember people saying that the show was boring because it didn‚Äôt have another ‚Äúworld-ending‚Äù catastrophe and was mostly small-scaled. But now you guys cry about how the MCU has too much grand-scale battles.


It‚Äôs ironic, because Hawkeye is literally a bit of a break from those things, and now the MCU fandom is calling for more shows and movies like it to return."
marvelstudios,Echo/Maya,"Anyone not like how she is portrayed in Hawkeye?

The whole brooding biker chick just didn‚Äôt work for me.

I liked the actress. Nothing against her. It‚Äôs the writing.

In the comics, I remember her just being elegant and fierce. While in the MCU she seems more of a blunt object. 

I think some of it has to do with her working with the track suit mafia and how incompetent they are. Just makes her seem a bit of a mess by association. 

If she was working as a seperate party from them, but still kept her link to King Pin, it would‚Äôve made her more interesting. 

I know her portrayal in the comics may be troublesome for some. It really leaned into the Native American imagery‚Ä¶stereotypes. I was in love with the art of the run I read back in the day. She‚Äôs also sold as some perfect dream girl for DD. Smart, beautiful, feminine‚Ä¶dangerous. I can see why Marvel wanted to step away from that in this portrayal.

Kraven: terrible choice for a movie unless they bring back Andrew Garfield (or Tobey but i‚Äôd much rather prefer Garfield) but they could do the Kravens Last Hunt storyline but instead of the Pov being from Peter they have most of the Movie through Kravens Pov and show peters Pov only a little bit kinda like Peter the same amount of screen time as antagonist in other superhero movies even though he‚Äôd be the protagonist. It‚Äôs be a different take on ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù movies if they did it that way and they could still say it‚Äôs a Kraven movie even though spider-man would be the protagonist, it‚Äôd also give us a different view of how villains are since most movies don‚Äôt really develop them like they do heroes, plus if it‚Äôs andrews spider-man he‚Äôs already had time to develop in other movies so we wouldn‚Äôt need that crazy amount of screen time as if he was a brand new actor/spider-man. that‚Äôs the only way i see that movie doing good because that story line is S tier in the comics and for it to have a take from Kravens for the majority of the movie would be wildly different and you can‚Äôt complain about that, if you wanna see the story from peters perspective go read the actual comic story but idk what do y‚Äôall think about that?"

And then in theory if there‚Äôs only 1 quantum realm for an infinite number of universes, it would mean anytime someone goes into the quantum realm they have a chance to run into a variant of themselves right? 

Also if there are an infinite number of universes who share one quantum realm, that realm has to be absolutely massive to keep so many different characters and their own variants separate from eachother"

marvelstudios,Mcu haters,"This has probably already been said but is anyone else getting the sense that other directors/people  from other film industries are seeing the hate the mcu has been getting and taking advantage of it ?  

Like when I think about it , why would people come to this sub to express how much they hate the mcu and only to point out flaws ? At this point they may as well make a ‚ÄúMCUflaws‚Äù subreddit, why do they want their negative opinions to be heard so bad when it‚Äôs not even really constructive criticism 

it has to be a lot of shills in here , the mcu was ahead of the game for movies lately especially with endgame it only make sense shills  would come and try to destroy the title so that lesser franchises can hold that title"
marvelstudios,How would you start off Avengers : Kang Dynasty?,"
Every Avengers movie opens with a conflict going on. Whether it‚Äôs the villain already winning against the heroes or our hero‚Äôs lying in defeat, the movie always opens nicely. 

So how do you see the next avengers movie opening up? Or how do you want it to begin?"

marvelstudios,The MCU should‚Äôve ended after No Way Home.,"Ragnarok was the perfect intro to the twilight of the MCU. The after Endgame, we have No away Home. We don‚Äôt need Far from home or anything like that. It would‚Äôve been the perfect epilogue."
marvelstudios,Marvel ‚ÄúSpecial Presentations‚Äù from the Multiverse,"How kickass would it be to see Marvel do some version of Multiversal one-offs? 

You could start with a Hitchcock-esque intro with Mojo sitting in his chair and flipping to other universes.  

Yes, I know it‚Äôs like What-If, but this would be Live Action and have Zero threads connecting to the MCU. 

The beauty is you can recast for every episode/movie.  

- Wolverine hunting Wendigo and maybe Puck from Alpha Flight makes an appearance. 

- Wastelanders (like the Podcasts) 

- Hulk as Joe Fixit bouncing at Star-Lords Lounge set in the late 80‚Äôs in a Noir film about Jessica Jones hunting for a mutant serial killer taking out Go-Go girls. 

I hate seeing Marvel tied down to even What-If having to tie into the MCU somehow.  The audience is capable of watching some Special Presentation projects where it‚Äôs a one and done cool concept with our favorite characters."

marvelstudios,The biggest problem isn‚Äôt quality over quantity‚Ä¶,"The biggest problem in the mcu right now isn‚Äôt quantity over quality. It‚Äôs the setting up for future events or spin offs that overshadows everything especially with the shows. As u know, the lack of story and the rushing during the end of the season of the shows r due to Disney putting a lot of filler that usually is to set up things. The movies aren‚Äôt so bad when it comes to this but movies such as antman quantumania definitely had kang as a villain to set up the next avengers movie which fits with the quantum realm aspect but isn‚Äôt truly a direct antman villain. The movie was good but I think more grounded has worked and would‚Äôve worked better to make the 3 antman film better."
marvelstudios,is the new antman movie worth watching,"I‚Äôve never really been a fan of the antman movies, and i‚Äôve been seeing mixed reviews about the new mcu film and i just want to know the thoughts of those who‚Äôve already seen it."
marvelstudios,A variation of variant veracity,"So I tried earlier to post a question about why some variants look different and some look the same, and I was told by the Mods that the question had been answered in the FAQ and the post was locked.

I read the answer in the FAQ and was left... unsatisfied by it. It talks about DNA and alleles, and since DNA is assigned randomly the same parents can create different looking children. Variants are therefore genetically siblings. Sounds great, but that doesn't really work. By that logic, there will be continual branching off as families would in real life.

By that logic, Loko has a brother who is an alligator and Thor a brother who is a frog, and the show Loki is about a romance between siblings. This seems to be wrong, to say the least. The FAQ has no source for this DNA theory. Is there any actual canon explanation for some variants being the same?"

marvelstudios,Mcu Phase 4 was garbage.,"I read a lot of other peoples posts on MCU phase 4 and I can't lie a good chunk of them were either, ""MCU Phase 4 is GREAT &amp; overhated"" or ""MCU phase 4 is good, stop being misogynistic"".

When this is just simply not the case. If you are honest with yourself you know Marvel Phase 4 was ASS. I will be comparing these movies to past marvel movies in Phase 2 &amp; 3. Not avengers/big movies because its unfair, I will compare it to Iron Man 1. (the first ever marvel movie with a lower budget BTW...) Also I would like to add before anyone try's some B.S of how I only like Iron Man 1 more because of RDJ or nostalgia, I will be rating these movies based upon writing, script, character development, and MCU development compared to Iron Man 1. 

Movies: 

Black Widow 5/10.

Shang-Chi 7/10.

Eternals 4/10.

Spiderman No way home: 7/10 (not taking in too account the nostalgia of the past character... guys...)

Dr strange MOM 4/10.

Thor L&amp;T 2/10. GARBAGE.

BP2 7/10

Ant-Man 3: 3/10 just trash... stop.

I wont even get into the shows... don't even try. they as fucking garbage, expect Loki and maybe falcon."

marvelstudios,Goodbye r/MarvelStudios,"It's been a great ride the past decade but my time here has to end. Due to unrealistic ideas, constant hammering of the MCU Creative process, or just the spoiled childish reactions, I have decided this place is too toxic for the average movie goer, or comic book fan. Everyone here is entitiled to their opinion but everyone seems to be entitled to source material or fan service far too more then letting a creative team lead and guide the way.  This sub has led on to create false expectations that just won't hit, and i'm not in the mood to be dissapointed by that variable again.

marvelstudios,Ant-Man 3 audience review,"In my opinion, this film was okay, but it could've been better. 

I definitely think that both Scott and Hank should have died during this film. Just as much as I think Kang should've escaped the Quantum Realm at the end of it. Marvel have repeatedly stated that Kang is supposed to be Thanos' replacement as the new Big Bad of the Multiverse Saga, but supposedly being killed by ANT-MAN of all people at the end of the climax and not killing him instead to prove how much of a threat he is? It's...it's not a good start for the guy. 

MODOK was weak. That's all I have to say about that. Just....weak. I didn't really see the point of him being in the film if I'm honest. 

Hope was hardly in it, considering that she's one of the titular characters in the film. Nine times out of ten she usually flew in to save the day. No other characterisation to her than that. 

Cassie should've become a hero because of Scott's death. It's not as powerful in the film as he's still alive. It's like she thought 'Everyone else in the family is a superhero, so I should be too.' 

I do think the old Disney CEO in charge was partly responsible for a rushed production such as this. As well as bad VFX because of VFX crew problems. But not every marvel film needs to make over a billion dollars. The Ant-man franchise is one of the MCU's lowest financial hits and it's definitely keeping with tradition. 

However, I still think that come guardians 3 the franchise will slowly be getting better again. They are focusing on quality over quantity again after all."
marvelstudios,ELI5: Who or what is Kang? Is Ant-Man Kang the same variant as Loki Kang? We're his intentions noble (at least according to him)?,"A casual watcher of the movies/series. Just trying to get it straight in my head. Would letting him escape the quantum realm been been a better move for ""humanity""?"
marvelstudios,How bad is it?,-
marvelstudios,Quantumania‚Äôs CGI wasn‚Äôt awful,"I watched Quantumania on Saturday and while there‚Äôs stuff story wise that could have been better, I think the CGI was pretty decent. Considering that 95% of the movie is green screen and computer animated characters I believe those elements blended pretty well with the real actors. What do you think? Did any instance of bad cgi stood out to you?"

marvelstudios,"I think the MCU should recast when actors exit their roles, like James Bond","If you ask me, the MCU should operate more like the comics, progressing on a sliding timescale. They should recast characters instead of killing them off or retiring them. It‚Äôs a formula that worked well for the Bond franchise for 30 years.

So many of Marvel‚Äôs most beloved characters have been around in the comics for over half a century, and as a result they have decades of great storylines available to adapt to live action in addition to a growing list of potential team-ups with newly introduced characters. And that isn‚Äôt even taking into account the comics that are still being written or have yet to be!

Killing off a character like Tony Stark means that we may never see any more storylines that center around him, like the brief fan favorite Superior Iron Man run. And Riri Williams will never get to team up with the hero that inspired her to create her Ironheart armor. Now that he‚Äôs retired, we‚Äôll never get to see a team up/face off like Steve Rogers and The Punisher, two characters that I think would be great to see together on-screen.

If Marvel recasted their successful characters, they would be able to continue exploring the different storylines and team-ups that fans love. The way I see it, as long as there are more great stories to tell, they shouldn‚Äôt end a character just because the actor is done with the role.

Anyone else agree or am I just a wacko?


P.S. As a side note, I also think they should be embracing the multiverse more and do stories that take place in alternate universes, like a live action 1602 or an R-rated Zombies movie. Maybe to make it more clear it‚Äôs not the mainline universe, they could recast the entire name ensemble."

I was down with the idea of changing the rings to bracelets, but they also never specified what the bracelets did power wise. Just some generic superpower stuff. The Mandarin‚Äôs 10 rings each have a specific ability and a much more interesting backstory I think. it would be an awful shame to never explore them."
marvelstudios,Was anyone else disappointed with doctor strange and multiverse of madness?,"In the first doctor strange movie during one of the post credit scenes‚Äî Mordo basically decided that he wanted to wipe out the sorcerers. I wish they would‚Äôve sticked to that plot for the second doctor strange movie. 

What should‚Äôve happened is Mordo desperately trying to get his hands on America Chavez and the dark hold so that he could travel through the multiverse to attempt to complete his objective.

So now with Kang the Conqueror dead, we are left with the big 3. 

Now all i hope is for these 3 to destroy various timelines, like alternate versions of superheroes and villains(similar to defender strange, maybe show him kill alternate thanos) to show of their strength. 
Then in the later saga i want the Kang the conqueror to somehow comeback and get his revenge on all 3 of them establishing him as a threat and later i want Kang the conqueror to get killed by Doom showing just how powerful he is and maybe make him the ruler of battleworld causing a multiversal war (?) and then the arrival of some strong superhero (mr fantastic?) who kills doom and dies along with it. On top of that i want HWR to be his(the one who dies with doom) apprentice who ensures to keep multiverse and timeline safe and hence is reinstated in his position, hence completing the saga by closing the loop."

marvelstudios,Shouldn't Cassie Lang be 14\15 in the Quantamania?,"So shouldn't Cassie be like 14 or something in Quantamania? She was 6 in the first movie which takes place in 2015. So that means she was born in 2009. In Ant-Man and the Wasp, she's 9. That makes sense because the movie takes place in 2018 slightly before Infinity War (as I understand it). But then how the hell is she so adult all of a sudden in Endgame and Quantamania if both movies take place in 2023. (It can be that Quantamania takes place in 2024 but she would be 15 then, not 18 according to Peyton Reed.

But one thing I surprisingly haven't seen a lot of is people saying what they would have done to end the show instead. So what would you have done? Tie everything back to the sitcom motif? Make Pietro somehow real? Give Wanda a stronger punishment for her actions? Have the whole thing culminate in a discussion a la the Loki finale? Or something else entirely?"

I‚Äôm not a comic book person but it seems like Kang relies very heavily on the angle of unexplainable future technology to solve all his problems. And I don‚Äôt particularly see an interesting motivation for all his conquering."
marvelstudios,"Yes, Doctor Strange DOES have an arc in 'Multiverse of Madness' (and it's perfect)","One of the most common complaints people have about 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness' is that the main character, Doctor Strange, has no arc whatsoever, and that, by the end of the film, he's no different than he was at the beginning. Honestly, I've never understood this complaint and I would like to address why it's completely untrue (and just yet another example of people desperately searching for anything to complain about).

(*First, I need to explain Strange and Christine's relationship from the first film since it's essential to understanding his arc in the second film.)*

**Early on in the film, we meet Stephen Strange and his colleague/ex-lover, Christine Palmer. It's clear that there's a spark between them and Strange invites her to a party.**

https://preview.redd.it/tx690wez7rka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a2d8cb8452b9012a856008c8a1e53e309b46c8d

**Getting ready for the party, Strange puts on a wristwatch given to him by Christine Palmer.**

**On his way to the party, Strange gets into a car crash and the watch (along with his hands) is damaged.**

https://preview.redd.it/a3f2jkkoarka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eaf2da54ffaa2a6d7104d974d523dc03fdc58b54

**Due to the damage the crash caused to his hands, Strange has a breakdown and pushes Christine away.**

https://preview.redd.it/krhy3utuarka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b2c4067d6070ef451d97a06f5833c550694b2e7b

**Later in the film, after the Ancient One has died, Strange visits the hospital and he has a moment with Christine. He tells her he has to go and they reference an earlier conversation about there being more than one way to save lives. This is Strange putting what he wants aside in order to do what's right. He is now Doctor Strange, master of the mystic arts.**

***A lot of people make the mistake of thinking this is the conclusion of their relationship, but it isn't, as you will see in the next image.***

https://preview.redd.it/p20p0wdjbrka1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=38cb83869507a450a538fe0ba5d0360a28e974ce

**At the very end of the film, after he has defeated Dormammu and Kaecilius, Strange puts his broken watch back on. The watch represents his heart and his relationship with Christine - both broken. However, he still keeps the watch on since his love for her isn't gone. Their relationship may be broken but he isn't over it.**

*(Now we get into the divisive 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness')*

**Strange wakes up from a nightmare and looks at the broken watch on his bedside table.**

**After the ceremony, the two talk about their relationship. Christine makes it clear that they never would have worked because Stephen always has to be the one holding the knife (a metaphor that essentially means he always has to be in control of everything).**

https://preview.redd.it/twauh80aerka1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=05211d5baeb9ba45728e15b704019313615b5e88

**Later in the film, once they cross the multiverse and wind up in Earth-838, Strange meets an alternate version of Christine Palmer. She tells him about the complicated relationship she had with her universe's Doctor Strange and how it didn't work out.**

https://preview.redd.it/7b0o59q2frka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b9bc16211b0812605f9d9872ff2dc32d3ef19766

**Later, once Strange and Christine are sent into an incursion-riddled universe, Earth-616 Strange comes across an evil variant of himself who lost his Christine and couldn't get over it. This shows 616 Strange what he could become if he doesn't get over the loss of Christine.**

https://preview.redd.it/pbvl3anhfrka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2d988b87fb27df35350b1e5e64a4fce21536602f

**After 616 Strange has defeated his evil self, he talks to 838 Christine. He tells her that he loves her in every universe and that he** ***does*** **want to let people in but just gets too scared. Christine tells him to face his fears.**

https://preview.redd.it/tkzpm7svfrka1.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1dabf98cdb602636ba651be1a2fba2beb7514e1a

**Once back home, Strange fixes the watch and puts it away. He has now resolved his relationship with Christine and has fixed his broken heart. He doesn't need the watch anymore just like he doesn't need Christine. He is finally over it.**

https://preview.redd.it/ge4l1vz7hrka1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fdaf1d95d179b74b0d283009de02dc0ebc2cf4ed

I know 'Multiverse of Madness' is divisive for many reasons (some of which I agree with), but Strange *does* have an arc in the film. It's clear as day. If you don't like the film then that's fine but just make sure it's for the right reasons."

marvelstudios,"Superhero fatigue is rubbish but, MCU fatigue is a genuine issue (and one that can be fixed)","The idea that on mass; people will lose interest in an entire genre of film has always been silly and reactionary. Superhero films aren't going anywhere however, the MCU while the biggest is ultimately just a universe in that genre, that certain segments of the critic, audience and fan spaces have become fatigued off.

We can't write them all off as haters. In 2017, DC faced this problem when Justice League financially failed after a series of divisive DCEU films. Some took advantage of the situation to hate, to divide, but many just didn't turn up because they were disappointed and fatigued with the state of DC.

For Marvel to avoid the fatigue setting in and becoming synonymous with the MCU they must address the MCU's bigger criticisms. **Personally, I have enjoyed Phases 4 &amp; 5 and don't have MCU fatigue** but, I can still see that an oversaturation of MCU content, has worsened the VFX crisis and affected quality control. You combine that with multiple CGI-heavy, hardcore sci-fi, deep comic-book lore films...and you get a part of the audience who are confused and tired of the MCU slate.

However, we talk about fatigue as if it sets in and is there forever! it's not. People seem to have quite short and nostalgic memories of MCU phases gone by because Marvel has struggled in the past and has always found ways of improving and reinventing itself. Ultimately just spacing out content a bit more and simplifying some story concerts would help them a lot and it's not hard to do.

So, while superhero fatigue is a silly myth, we shouldn't just dismiss MCU fatigue. Meanwhile, we also can't pretend that this will last forever and marks the end is nigh.

marvelstudios,Do you think the villains should win a little more often?,"considering that every 2 to 3 months a movie or TV series comes out.

considering the marvel universe now consists of 30/40 main heroes, as many of secondary heroes, new upcoming heroes, plus all their variants of the multiverse, so there is no shortage of them.

Isn't it a bit strange (and anti-climactic) that heroes win 99% of story arcs?

It's like a basketball/soccer team winning every single match they play. It may go down by 1, by 10, by 20 points, it suffers, it is forced to sacrifice and lose, but in the end it invariably recovers and triumphs.

A little boring in the long run.

I understand that's the beauty of superhero stories, reassuring, Good  always triumphs in the end...but wouldn't it make everything a little more interesting, unpredictable, if sometimes the villains won, say, 10-15% of the story arcs?"

This scene is actually from Loki S2. It's hard to tell if Mobius already knows who Loki is or not, but we know he gets his memories back, obviously.

And the only hero we have is Red Skull, who had a traumatic childhood, picked up by older man who was the leader of a terrible cult, and had to battle demons to turn his life around. Now he fights super villains with no power other than his cunning and former cult training??

marvelstudios,ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA Review,"I came into this movie ready to cringe. I‚Äôve seen the memes. I‚Äôve heard the hate towards the MCU moving forward. After some unfortunate Marvel entries, I was ready to feel disappointment. I‚Äôm here to say I don‚Äôt fully understand the low RT critic rating. Do they really think this movie is worse than Incredible Hulk, Dark World, and of all movies, Eternals? 

The Good: 
The CGI-The comparison to Spy Kids is ridiculous. The CGI is honestly comparable to Star Wars. The environment, the characters, and the villain definitely felt like Star Wars wrapped in a Marvel skin. It is clear where the inspiration came from. 
Jonathan Majors-Dude looks like he has worked out to defeat every hero in the Multiverse. He looks, sounds, and acts incredible. 
Action Scenes-Many of the fight scenes kept me engaged. I like how Cassie still needed to learn the suit. We got to see Janet‚Äôs badass fighting skills too. 

The Bad:
MODOK-There was no need for this callback. The character was pointless in the grand scheme of the movie. This was a waste. I didn‚Äôt even understand his motivations. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be A Dick‚Äù. 
Father-Daughter Relationship-This should have been the heart of the movie, but it fell flat. I loved the dynamic in the previous movies. Blame the actress or the writing, but Cassie had no personality besides being entitled. 
The Ending-Antman should have died. Kang losing this battle did not make any sense. The Conqueror variant lost to Antman, but has killed Thor in another universe? What?He‚Äôs the ‚ÄúBig Bad‚Äù and he‚Äôs lost twice now. It‚Äôs a terrible setup for this saga. 

Overall: 6/10. This movie gives me weird vibes. I think it‚Äôs a bad Antman film, but decent movie. If this was a weird plot to a Star Wars film, I think it would have graded higher with critics/audiences. I‚Äôm sure Star Wars fans may hate me saying this, but Kang is mostly what I‚Äôve wanted from Darth Vader for over a decade now. Yet, as an Antman film, this feels disconnected to the trilogy and moves nothing really forward. Kang is a A+ villain facing a B level hero. It‚Äôs better than Ant-Man 2 (which is forgettable), but not on the same level as Ant-Man 1. At least, I enjoyed it more than MoM and Love &amp; Thunder."
marvelstudios,"IMO the best way to make a stand-alone Hulk movie is to have Bruce Banner hired to investigate a feral, seemingly unkillable man in the Canadian wilderness. AKA the Wolverine","In a sort of the inverse of the animated *Hulk vs. Wolverine,* Bruce Banner would be hired to investigate a claim of an unkillable man that is causing some issues up in the Canadian wilderness. Wolverine has lost his humanity and is living ferally in the mountains. The Hulk is needed to bring him in.

This could serve as The MCU's version of the Wolverine introduction. Having the two classic characters clash on screen would be a perfect way to set Banner apart in his own story and have a greater X-Men presence movie into the next Phase. 

Having these two face-off in tree-smashing, boulder-destroying, earth-shaking battles and eventually Bruce helping Logan connect back to his humanity would be Fantastic.

marvelstudios,What What if....? episodes would you like to see?,My thought is What if Thanos reached Asgard? This would be similar to the events of Thor Ragnarok except that Thanos reached Asgard before it was destroyed by Surtur in his pursuit for the space stone. Would he end up teaming with Thor to fight Hela? Would he team up with Hela? What would happen is something i'd really like to know.
marvelstudios,Getting tired of the hypocrisy of this sub and of MCU fans.,"So i‚Äôm a huge fan of the Scarlet Witch. I grew up watching her on X-Men evolution as a young girl and she is a superhero i‚Äôve always looked up to. I personally love Elizabeth Olsen‚Äôs portrayal of Wanda, she‚Äôs an incredible actress and really no complaints from me when it comes to that.

What I have an issue with is seeing how quickly people on this sub have dismissed Romani representation (not Romanian, ROMANI, search it up if you need to.) I‚Äôve always known Wanda is Romani and Jewish in the comics (although her recent retcon removed Magneto as her father, so she still remains Romani). I‚Äôve recently been interested in Wanda‚Äôs backstory, and I was very interested to see that her Romani heritage is very important to her.

Looking through some of these posts calling out the erasure of her romani heritage in the MCU, it‚Äôs saddening to see how dismissive people are of Romani representation. The lengths people are going to defend Marvel‚Äôs choice to remove Wanda from her culture is very gross in my opinion.

Of course there‚Äôs nothing that can be done, and while I love Elizabeth‚Äôs rendition of Wanda, I still can acknowledge that it was wrong of Marvel to erase Wanda‚Äôs identity and culture. So what‚Äôs the point of the post?

Fantastic 4 is coming up and i‚Äôve recently learnt that Dr. Doom is romani, I had no idea. I think this is an opportunity for marvel to do the right thing and cast a Romani actor, i‚Äôve seen Charlie Clapham (a Romani actor) post on twitter about this, and he looks perfect for Doom.

When I saw Oscar Isaac get the role for Moon Knight, I got excited because we would be getting some latino representation, but upon learning that Marc is Jewish, I felt bad. I don‚Äôt want us to get representation if it means the erasure of another community. 

As a woman of color, being a marvel stan isn‚Äôt easy, you‚Äôre constantly mocked, not taken seriously, ridiculed, and asked to prove that you‚Äôre a real fan. So I know there may be many comments saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that deep, just get any actor who can play the part well‚Äù.

My point is, if we want representation done right, we should advocate for every minority group (Romani people are poc, have a history of oppression, are treated horribly in europe to this day), and if we don‚Äôt take the representation of one group seriously, or disregard it, then we are not calling for actual diversity, only diversity when it benefits our own ethnic groups.

I‚Äôm latina myself, but to any Jewish or Romani people who may read this, your representation is important and valid, and i‚Äôm tired of this sub acting like it‚Äôs not. I hope marvel keeps this in mind."

marvelstudios,Thunderbolts has some good potential for character interactions and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm somewhat excited for the film.,"I know some people haven‚Äôt been to keen on the Thunderbolts roster due to lacking various characters and the roster seemingly being somewhat lacking in diversity in terms of power sets, however imo what make the roster a decent line up is how much potential there is in the interactions between the various characters. Whether they be friendships, rivalries, or straight hating one another. 

For example you have Bucky, Yelena, and Taskmaster that have all been straight up brainwashed into being weapons for a corrupt and evil group. They all have the shared experience of being brainwashed into being an assassin but different ways of dealing with it, and the various ways that these characters will rebound off on another has some good potential. 

Bucky seems to be striving to do good, seeking redemption and using that to help overcome his guilt and grief for his actions. It‚Äôs very possible Bucky will be the conscious of the team that tries to steer them straight, especially if he‚Äôs the defacto leader as Fiege described it. 

Where as Yelena seems to just be doing what‚Äôs she‚Äôs paid to do without any interest in being a hero, and any attempts from Bucky to push her to be better, she might just find irritating and grating and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if her arc is learning to be a hero or just doubling down on looking out for herself. 

Taskmaster is borderline in the same boat as Bucky, she was brainwashed by her dad to be a living super soldier assassin that did everything he asked, however due to this it‚Äôs hard to see how she‚Äôll handle it because her character is the least fleshed out. They may do a turn around and make Taskmaster more like her comic counterpart. 

Additionally Ghost‚Äôs life was very similar to Bucky‚Äôs, Taskmaster and Yelena, in that she was taken and used as an assassin for SHIELD when she was a kid, with the promise that they‚Äôd cure her condition which they never did. So Ghost as well was forced to be a weapon without a choice, so Bucky can probably bond over that as well with her, as Ghost might be more be more likely to try and be friendly than say Yelena would be to Bucky.

Additionally in regard to Red Guardian and Walker, both of which share the theme of being used and discarded by their countries, which can be argued also happened to Bucky, considering governments were trying to shoot him on site back in Civil War despite being a WW2 POW, and the only reason he‚Äôs not dead is because of Steve.

Bucky already arguably has a rivalry with Walker from FATWS, and it‚Äôs possible Red Guardian heard rumours or legends of the Winter Soldier.

Red Guardian and Walker could either have a rivalry due to their affiliations as failed symbols for their country or even develop a friendship over how they both did there duty and were shunned for it. 

Granted this requires for the film to actually be well written, and good writing isn‚Äôt exactly a sure fire thing at the moment, especially considering it‚Äôs being written by the Black Widow writers. I will say though that despite disliking Black Widow, I thought the character interactions were one of the stronger parts of the film."

Steve Rogers didn‚Äôt have his shield, but he‚Äôd been active from 2016-2018 without it already. I‚Äôd bet that even if he *and* Tony were both still active with the Avengers they likely didn‚Äôt go on any missions together.

Who else?"
marvelstudios,I think GOTG3 will be one of the greatest MCU movies,"So maybe I'm buying into a false hope a little bit, but I really believe GOTG3 is going to be one of the shining gems of the MCU filmography.

The Guardians are like the overachievers of the MCU in that nobody really believed a movie starring Chris Pratt, a tree, and a trash panda would ever be worth watching. However, their story arc has not only proved to be entertaining, but also it has formed perhaps some of the most touching and emotional relationships between any characters in the MCU.

I know the MCU have been accused of putting out deceiving movie trailers recently, but the trailers for Guardians 3 have me convinced that this is going to be an emotional roller coaster in every sense of the word. Some beloved characters will be tested to their limits, and some will undoubtedly be lost along the way. The trailers are painting this movie to be a sad, happy, emotional, hilarious, epic finale to the Guardians trilogy.

While James Gunn put out a somewhat disappointing movie in Love &amp; Thunder, Guardians seems to be his baby and I have confidence that he won't let this one slip away.

I haven't looked forward to an MCU movie more than this since End Game, and I have a gut feeling that this one will be in many peoples top 5 MCU movies lists for years to come."

marvelstudios,Disney+ TV pitch,"Disney+ series ‚ÄòTaskmaster and the Ghost‚Äô

Both Taskmaster and Ghost are sent on a secret mission to investigate AIM underground research facilities. They discover that AIM has been experimenting on ‚Äúmutants‚Äù, individuals created after the cosmic energy from the snap unlocked a mysterious, dormant gene inside a large portion of the Earth‚Äôs population.

The main focus of the series is about Taskmaster coming to terms with being a controlled ‚Äúmonster‚Äù, and about Ghost wanting to continue her search for a cure, while also battling depression and ultimately having to come to terms with the cure may not be possible.

George Tarleton, the antagonist, would have a disease and Rogue would be his prized catch to experiment on as this version would not only have the ability absorb the powers of others, but to also cure sicknesses only with drastic side effects.

Taskmaster and Ghost would work together to keep Rogue safe while saving other mutants. There would be a big moment where they use Rogue to try and ‚Äúcure‚Äù them and it would briefly work for Ghost. There‚Äôs also a mysterious voice that communicates with Rogue, as well as a few other mutants, which would be revealed to be Charles Xavier in the final 2 episodes.

**The reason we wouldn‚Äôt have known about mutants in the MCU is because the government (or SHIELD) had kept everything under wraps in fear of the response from everyday civilians learning about mutants.**

-Taskmaster would begin morphing into the more comic accurate version of Taskmaster and by the end of the season, she‚Äôd either be a fully realized anti-hero, or villain, depending on what happens going forward.

-Ghost would become more of an anti-hero and would finally accept her abilities. She would be offered to join Charles and Rogue in hopes to learn to be able to control her abilities.

-It would set up the MCU‚Äôs mutants and X-Men.

-We‚Äôd have a more comic accurate MODOK in terms of personality, character development and more.

Main characters

-Antonia ‚ÄòToni‚Äô Dreykov/ Taskmaster

-Ava Starr/ Ghost

-Ana Marie/ Rogue

-George Tarleton/ MODOK

Was he just a member of a super strong species? If so, why did all of the other super strong thanos-like dudes die?

I'm an MCU baby and haven't read a single comic. If anyone has an answer, either comic or movie-related that I missed, I'd love to hear it. Thanks!"
marvelstudios,My thoughts and ideas about Quantamania and Kang‚Äôs role in the MCU,"!&gt;After taking time to think about it, the problem with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantamania was Kang. I previously thought someone should‚Äôve died and/or Kang should‚Äôve escaped, but that‚Äôd compromise the hope and optimism inherent to the Ant-Man films. Making Kang the villain created an interesting dynamic in which it has to choose between doing right by the MCU or doing right by the Ant-Man films. Jonathan Majors did an amazing job as Kang and was definitely the highlight of the movie‚Ä¶but he shouldn‚Äôt have been fully introduced here.

So how do we fix it? Easy. We don‚Äôt introduce him yet. Use him similarly to Thanos. Make him a looming threat that we get consistent hints at and build towards.

First, we have to start the hints earlier. The best Phase 4 projects to do this in are What If? and Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. Specifically in Dr. Strange, it‚Äôd make sense for Nathaniel Richards to be hinted as the author of the Darkhold. Maybe even Wandavision can give a very vague hint and Dr. Strange 2 would give a clearer hint.

Next, in Ant-Man, have Kang escape when the Ant-Family is sucked into the Quantam Realm and make MODOK the main villain. The story can simply be about the Ant-Family trying to escape while Darren tries to capture and kill them. They can even still find a way to have him die realizing how he‚Äôd lost his humanity. Kang could also leave a note for Janet letting her know that he will be coming to conquer her universe in time (this note would replace the Council of Kangs postcredits scene). I‚Äôd leave the flashbacks intact though.

Now where do we introduce Kang? The most obvious place would be GotG 3. After all, the Guardians have the largest sphere of influence and our first time really seeing Thanos was in Guardians 1. However, the stakes of this next Guardians movie appears to be more personal. Forcing Kang into the film would present a similar issue to the one he caused in Quantamania. 

Instead I believe moving The Marvels to the end of Phase 5 and fully introducing him there would be the best option. This is for two reasons. For one, aside from Guardian 3 and The Marvels, the Phase 5 slate is very grounded in scope. Seeing Kang in one of the other projects, aside from MAYBE Secret Invasion and obviously Loki S2, would feel out of place. Second, if any one character with an upcoming project can face off against a Thanos-level threat and survive the encounter, it‚Äôd be Captain Marvel. Let them fight and have Kang whoop Carol while Monica and Kamala are working to help her escape. This scene would operate similarly to Thanos‚Äôs entrance in Ragnarok.

I think this also works by giving each phase a different status quo.

Phase 4: Kang is out there somewhere
Phase 5: Kang is free and is on his way
Phase 6: Kang is here and we are in danger

And Luis recapping the movie as we're watching it is just stupid and derails the entire film with how much time it wastes on a bad joke.

marvelstudios,What does the MCU look like in about 30 YEARS (in a scenario where it makes it that far)? Will retired characters stay retired? A new generation of characters we've never heard of or have yet to be created? Recasted heroes? Universe reset?,"There has been nothing like the MCU.. It's journey and dedication of keeping a connected universe has  successfully transcended for over a decade and across 30+ movies/shows, while also being able to turn lesser known comic heroes into household names; the ironman character would never be as popular as he is now if it weren't for the movies and RDJ's performance. With that being said, the comics are different from the movies in which the comic characters can be any age and can comeback full-time whenever the writers want, while actors in movies will inevitably age out of roles. 

So with the MCU being so attached to it's actors, characters being retired and a new generation of young actors coming in, do you think the MCU will stay committed to the same single continuous story after 30-50 years? Do they completely shelf mainstays like Doctor Strange, Scott Lang, Thor when their times are up in favor of having new characters taking over for the old ones and building them up to become household names (much like Shang-Chi, Yelena, Kate, etc.)? I feel like if this happens in 30 years, we will have a whole hero lineup that consists of characters that are either unknown or has yet to exist in the comics (maybe even original characters in the MCU) and that may be very interesting to see. I also think people will really start to miss seeing the OG characters in the movies.

A timeline reset may take away from everything the MCU has accomplished and has built up to. However if you're open to the idea, can you see opportunity for new and fresh iterations of popular characters like Tony Stark and Steve Rogers later down the road with new actors? It will always be a tough task to top the previous actor's performance since they were so well done and attachment/loyalty the fanbase has to those versions of the characters may set the bar too high for any new actor to step in the role and be accepted.. but it's been done many times before in the comic movie world and I'd be curious to see another solo movie with a new version of Tony Stark's Ironman and how that would go; possibly by keeping the main fundamentals but adapting/altering different aspects like his age (making him younger than he was in the 2008 movie), making him a tad more serious + daring, adapting the ""demon in a bottle"" comic arc a littler closer, etc."

marvelstudios,Unconventional endings,Are some thing I‚Äôd like to see more often in the MCU.

marvelstudios,I liked Quantamania but the main problem was that Antman was in the movie,"This movie suffered from the ""cookie cutter"" issue in that the Antman family did not need to be in the movie. As it was, you could just replace AntFamily with, say the GOTG, and you have the same movie with the same outcome (just make it happen in space instead of the quantum realm). 

The movie solely existed to set up Kang as powerful and to let us see the end credit scene of the start of the Kang Dynasty. Which is a complete waste of Scott Lang. In fact, there is no character growth for Scott Lang, and the only character development we get is that Cassie has a suit. Thats it.

Honestly, if they just called this movie ""The Conqueror"" had Kang as the protagonist of the movie (like they did with Thanos in Infinity War) and have the person who leads the rebellion and defeats him be a masked person named Nathaniel, this would have been an awesome movie.  

As it stands, I feel like I just watched a two-hour end-credit scene."

marvelstudios,"I am a POC, but I find all hype around representation very condescending","I'm a brown guy, from South Asia. As a kid, I grew up with entertainment where most of the heroes were white males. Never once did the fact that they were 'white' even strike me when I was getting inspired by them. I used to relate to so much about these fictional white heroes. I used to see myself as them, aspire to be brave and heroic. Skin color being the last thing, my innocent brain ever focused on.

Nowadays, I find this hype around representation growing like some revolution, flamed by the people who stand to make money. I see it being taken seriously by the big money companies, by the agenda driven media, any mostly by outraged individuals on the internet. But everyone misses one thing.

It's not necessary that we relate to our own skin color or gender. My daughter was more inspired by Iron Man than Wonder Woman. She cheers more for Thor than Captain Marvel. Sometimes, I could find myself relating more some white females than brown males. Relatability has nothing to do with skin color at all. I don't find my identity being represented by a brown male in MCU. Because my identity has little to do with my color or genitals. Because being represented by some random fictional individual of my same skin color means nothing to me. 

And the only thing this explicit 'representation' does is pave more ways to classify ourselves as Black, White, Asian, Indian, Women, etc. And using some character with the same skin color or genitals as a representation of my identity is just condescending. 

So that's my rant. Fuck representation. Use any colored individuals you want for your fictional characters. Even if they are all 'white', I don't care. Because you don't need to have the same amount of melanin in your skin to represent me as a human."

marvelstudios,The marketing for The Sentry would be a lot of fun.,"The Sentry is a relatively new hero, but when he was created they created a fictional creation story where he was a long forgotten creation of Stan Lee. They released some new comics in the style of old school Stan Lee comics where The Sentry teamed up with a bunch of popular heroes and had adventures with them. 

They could introduce him as the first Marvel TV series that came out in the 70s, and they decided to reboot it. Release some episodes of the 70 series before moving into the modern era, or just have flashback scenes every episode."
marvelstudios,What was Scott Lang‚Äôs character arch in Quantumania?,"So I recently watched Quantumania and I thought it was an okay movie. Ant-man is one of my favs and I really liked Kang. I‚Äôm genuinely confused on if there was any character development here for Scott?

If we look at the trilogy as a whole; Ant-man 1 he goes from ex-con to best dad, Ant-man 2 Scott and Hope‚Äôs partnership is explored a little more and they brought in Goliath to rival Hank‚Äôs smarts, Ant-man 3 we get Cassie thinking her dad is lame like every teenager (although if my dad saved the world and wrote a book I would think the opposite).

I think it starts with Scott not wanting to help other people. However we already know from Endgame he lost some time but not his daughter completely. So he was willing to help those in need. Then by the end he‚Äôs helping the whole Quantum revolution and his daughter sees him as honorable. Idk it feels a little weird, like they created this problem just for this movie and to have his daughter and him be on the same page. 

Sorry if I‚Äôm answering my own question here, but seemed like a little out of place for Scott. I guess having him do anything to get back the childhood he missed with his daughter (from the trailers) was kind of out of place for his goofy aesthetic but I think if done right it would have been a really impactful message.

I think Darren Cross had more obvious character development in this film."

marvelstudios,(Bit of a rant) my thoughts on the MCU," the biggest thing wrong with the mcu is that every movie they produce is just to set up some other big movie. i miss when every movie felt individual to it's own thing and they put the 'expanding the MCU' plot in the backshadow of the movie to the point you'd have to rewatch to understand why this movie connects with this and that. thats why the original iron man movies were a success and captain america, now it just feels your watching for the sake of just getting to the end of it all

&amp;#x200B;

 but it's not always the case for example i really liked shang chi it felt fresh and individaul and the watcher gets a sense of not linguring on to the idea of 'this movie connects with this and that!. Honestly i think MCU should take a page of of DC's book and make more superhero movies that disconnect completely to the MCU like a seperate X-Men universe but everyone wants every hero to be the MCU. Another MCU project that doesn't fall to this problem is  Moon Knight Arguably the best marvel show disney has dropped along with Loki"
marvelstudios,Why Kang Doesn't Work (Quantumania spoilers),-
marvelstudios,How to fix Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"
Quantumania is a fundamentally flawed film in a way I haven‚Äôt seen before from the MCU. Outside of Kang the conqueror (who is absolutely fantastic but unfortunately shows up too late to save the movie) The film needs a MASSIVE overhaul. Here are my suggestions 

There are some great fight scenes in the film. However the 2 biggest battles are absolutely horrendous. There is so much clutter in the background, so many things happening it‚Äôs hard to follow what is going on. Our characters get lost among all the cgi noise and because of that it‚Äôs easy to zone out during those scenes. A very easy way to fix this is to remove a lot of random clutter and laser beams in the background. I‚Äôm not saying to take them out of the scene, just clean up the surroundings a bit. The fight scenes that do work are great because it feels more intimate. the focus Is on 1-3 characters and I can actually enjoy what is going on 

This movie needs to breatheeee. I was unable to connect and immerse myself in the story because of the constant back and forth and jarring cuts in the first half of the film. If the movie allowed time for us to digest what was happening, I wouldn‚Äôt feel as disconnected. I‚Äôd also like to add that this would allow for the characters to actually have a relationship with one another rather than have rushed sentimental moments mid-battle or just spurt out exposition. 

The quantum realm is a very imaginative sandbox. You can tell the concept artists had a blast making the various creatures and QR residents. however while the Quantum Realm can and SHOULD be weird, it needs to be grounded in realism. it still needs to make sense. An alien that looks like broccoli is weird but make sense. A giant floating head created due to unstable pym particles, is weird but makes sense. A building that flies and is somehow alive that does not match the QR‚Äôs fluid environment Does not make sense. It‚Äôs just weird because ‚Äúooh it‚Äôs the QR look how weird it is‚Äù you can cut the building out of the film and the plot remains the same. Quantumania while it does have jokes is played as a more serious film. It‚Äôs a bit harder to take a scene of a sentient building caressing a dying sentient building in its arms seriously in this type of tone. 

The QR is supposedly this vast realm. make us FEEL that way. Have characters actually travel to different places over time. Don‚Äôt have the pyms just go from fungi to a desert without showing us. Also don‚Äôt allow the kang the ability to travel anywhere in the QR at an instant it makes the QR feel small.

Flesh out what the quantum realm is exactly. In the prior movies it‚Äôs established as a place you enter when you go subatomic. Establish to the audience that shrinking down is one of the gateways to enter the realm(but it‚Äôs actually not part of earth 616.)

The QR is this ooey gooey place so why are there a bunch of humanoid aliens there? Where did they come from? well my suggestion is the residents that aren‚Äôt gooey animalistic creatures could be survivors of the previous multiversal war and the QR is a combined remnant (maybe created by kangs)

Originally bill murray had a larger role in the film. Either give bill a prominent role or cut him out of the film. In the final version He added nothing to the plot.

Combine some of the freedom fighters into one character. Like almost every character in this film I was unable to care about what these characters were doing due to a lack of any character arc. There was too many and not enough time to develop them. Combine VEB and lightbulb man. Combine Jantorra and quaz. Also don‚Äôt make them freedom fighters until the end of the 2nd act. Instead just have them be survivors.
they are mostly scared of kang and choose to run and hide without fighting back. However one of the survivors(Jantorra) wants to fight fight back and reclaim their home. This will play into what I think should be the theme of the film. I‚Äôll get into that later. 

Introduce kang much earlier. Instead of Scott and Cassie meeting the freedom fighters have them meet MODOK who brings them to kang. Have Scott go on an adventure with MODOK to retrieve the sphere while cassie is held hostage. This allows the stakes to resonate and MODOK‚Äôs redemption to feel more earned. Introducing kang earlier also gives the film some much needed focus much earlier as in the original version the plot or lack there of just meanders until MODOK shows up. 

Have the pyms meet up with the freedom fighters who helps search for Scott meanwhile cassie escapes from kang domain‚Äôs and meets up with the pyms and this allows us to see hope‚Äôs relationship with Cassie which we haven‚Äôt seen before.

Once Scott enters the probability storm the rest of the general plot largely remains unchanged from there on. Kang shows up steals the sphere from Scott. Cassie is with them and in order to try and get home they need to stop kang leading to the 3rd act.

This movie needs a central theme. Kang belittles the ant-fam and eventually underestimates them multiple times in the original film. That‚Äôs great. Lean more into that. Make the film a David and Goliath story. Scott in the beginning of the film is on top of the world. he stopped thanos, he saved the universe. However when he gets to the QR he‚Äôs in an unknown place with no avengers against a thanos level villain. Have kang break him mentally so Scott loses confidence and starts to have self doubt. On his way to the energy core Scott faces many creatures in the QR and starts to regain his confidence. by the end of the second act after kang steals the core from him that‚Äôs when he regroups and starts to believe that they are capable of stopping kang along with the help of the newly formed freedom fighters. Forgot to mention 
Janet in this version was never a freedom fighter. She also ran away from kang in fear desperately looking for a way out but she had always regretted not putting a stop to kang and vows to rectify that"

Shows that are just as important as the movies moving forward (Wandavison for example set up Doctor Strange 2)

Mix of both, continue having important shows and also have ""side stories""

Other: (special presentations and animated shows)

I personally have been enjoying most of the shows (my friends think there's too many shows and are falling behind now. Plus they don't care for each new hero) I think Marvel should continue what they're doing and hopefully figure out the sweet spot here (Secret invasion sounds excellent) (Echo/Ironheart probably doesn't need their own full length series but i wouldn't mind a 2-3 episode mini series for those characters)

What do you think?"
marvelstudios,Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania imo,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a ""comfort-zone"" cinecomic, which instead of taking risks builds the foundations of a larger and more complex narrative arc. It does so starting from a great face, Jonathan Majors' Kang, who represents the main flash of a solid, funny and at times spectacular film. We probably needed ""that extra something"" that Payton Reed and Marvel Studios were unable to pack, while triggering a very intriguing plot for the continuation of the Multiverse Saga. Between Majors' performance and interesting post-credit scenes, the third installment of the Ant-Man film saga opens Phase 5 of the MCU, and albeit with a few twists, leaves us with a solemn promise: a new and dangerous ""Dynasty "" has finally begun."
marvelstudios,I am worried about Marvel's Phase 5 (Lmk in the comments if you agree),-
marvelstudios,"Quantumania and the Sacred Timeline, and the questions it creates","Quantumania seems to imply that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes with the Sacred Timeline than we were lead to believe- and creates a lot of questions while implying a lot of unseen answers.

In Quatumania, Janet VanDyne reveals to her family (and the audience) that she has spent 30 years in the Quantum Realm, some of it with Kang, and then a majority of it rebelling against him before leaving.

We also learn that Kang was exiled into the Quantum realm so he would be trapped outside of the multiverse/time and not able to return. This seems to imply changes made to the multiverse/timeline does not affect what goes on in the Quantum Realm.

In Loki, we learn that the Sacred Timeline is this single ribbon of time kept sacrosanct- meaning everything happening from Captain America all the way up until Avengers Endgame is the canon Sacred Timeline.

In order for what happened in Quantumania to make sense, we have to assume the following: Kang, locked outside of the multiverse/timeline, met Sacred Timeline (ST going forward) Janet VanDyne, had their interactions and history, and then she returned to the Sacred Timeline. If we infer by their interactions in Quantumania, Kang and Krylar have not seen Janet in a very long time, have distinct memories of her, and she seems to be the only Janet variant who has interacted with either of them in the Quantum Realm- a realm outside of the multiverse/timeline.

This seems to imply some unseen revelations: In order for Kang to meet ST Janet VanDyne, and have everything happen in Loki and the Sacred Timeline, Kang was exiled to the Quantum Realm before He Who Remains used Alioth to prune the multiverse and isolate the sacred timeline. This means ST Janet met Kang after he was exiled, and from ST Janet's PoV, she spent 30 years in the Quantum Realm before escaping.

After ST Janet escapes, He Who Remains must have used Alioth to isolate the Sacred Timeline and establish the TVA, and then went on to live for ""a million lifetimes"". This is the only way Quantumania-Loki-Kang timelines make sense. Otherwise, you'd have a bunch of Janet VanDyne variants getting exiled to the quantum realm during the Sacred Timeline-time loop, meeting Kang and Krylar again and again. Quantumania implies that only one Janet VanDyne met Kang and Krylar, and they have only seen/met the same one we know of.

So putting this all together, this is how I view the ""timeline"" of events for Kang's banishment, and He Who Remain's reign:

The Sacred Timeline happens as usual, and ST Janet VanDyne is trapped in the Quantum Realm. During the Multiverse War we learn of in Loki, Kang is banished to the Quantum Realm. 30 years in the Quantum Realm occurs, Janet and Kang fall out, and Janet is eventually rescued. Avengers Endgame happens, and He Who Remains uses Alioth to destroy the multiverse/timelines to isolate and protect his Sacred Timeline. Kang/Krylar/Darren are all in the Quantum Realm while this happens.

After a million lifetimes, Loki and Sylvie show up, and Sylvie kill He Who Remains. No longer isolated, the Sacred Timeline starts branching into the multiverse. The Council of Kangs is reincarnated. ST Lang, Pym, and the VanDynes return to the Quantum Realm and discover much has changed. So I would have to believe, that after Janet is rescued, millions of lifetimes in the Quantum Realm pass. Kang builds his empire, the only survivor of his timeline and the last multiversal war. His jailor has been He Who Remains, who has been pruning timelines to make sure no one re-enters the Quantum Realm to help Kang escape.

At least, this is how I view it. It doesn't make sense there is more than one Quantum Realm, so we have to assume the same Quantum Realm exists underneath and between the layers of the multiverse, and is not affected by any of the changes made to it. Kang has likely been trapped far longer than we perceive it, and Sylvie really did free Kang after setting loose the multiverse. 

The only thing that doesn't make sense, is how this newest incarnation of the Council of Kangs has knowledge of the Exile, unless they retained their knowledge of their past lives after their reincarnation, or if they learned about them because they are all super-geniuses."

The difference is that while Scott‚Äôs different possibilities are all confused, they eventually cooperate with each other. Kang possibilities will all want to conquer and defeat each other.

marvelstudios,Kang Dynasty ending theory [QUANTUMANIA SPOILERS},"**\*\*\*Spoilers for** ***Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania*** **&amp; Jonathan Hickman's** ***Avengers*****/*****Secret Wars*** **run\*\*\***

Not sure if this idea has already been floated around, but I just thought about it the other day while mulling over *Quantumania*. It's how I think *The Kang Dynasty* will end, and what the premise of *Secret Wars* will be. Basically, I think that the upcoming two-part Multiverse Saga finale will borrow a lot of its premise from Jonathan Hickman's 2015 series (plus his preceding *Avengers*/*New Avengers* run), rather than the 1984 original *Secret Wars* comic. This is purely because of all the talk of Incursions, which it sounds like is where the Kang stuff is headed.

In Hickman's run, the impending threat for the heroes is that there's essentially a chain reaction of Incursions going on throughout the multiverse, with universes colliding &amp; wiping each other out. It turns out that these Incursions are actually being engineered by these nigh-omnipotent cosmic entities called the Beyonders. Long story short, this eventually reaches a point where there are only 2 universes left (the main Marvel universe &amp; the Ultimate universe) &amp; they are in the process of colliding - which they do, essentially wiping everything in the multiverse out bar a few survivors. At the same time, Doctor Doom is able to kill the Beyonders &amp; take their power, which enables him to scoop up the survivors and create Battleworld - a realm of his own where they live and he rules as God-Emperor Doom.

Given what we learn in *Quantumania*, I can see *The Kang Dynasty* ending a similar way, only you substitute the Beyonders for the Council of Kangs, and Doom for Kang himself (specifically the Exile variant who is the main villain of *Quantumania*). It's revealed that Kang actually started the Multiversal War because he saw that all the inter-universal interactions between his variants would ultimately result in 'endless Incursions', and that the multiverse is dying even now. And it doesn't look like the Council are doing anything to stop this any time soon, given that the Immortus-looking one gathered every variant that he could together, likely to launch an assault on the MCU.

So I'm guessing this will be the main story of *The Kang Dynasty* \- the Council attacks, our heroes fight back and maybe even win against then, but it's too late as the Council has already caused too much damage with their multiversal antics (the Incursion caused by Strange that Clea mentions might be a factor as well), and the multiverse is destroyed. This is where Kang/the Exile comes in - he's probably still alive, the film is called *The KANG Dynasty* after all. I'm not sure if he'll fight alongside the heroes against the Council from the beginning, or just swoop in at the end. But either way, I feel like he'll be the one to ultimately save whoever is left before the multiverse ends, and then somehow create his own version of Battleworld with a jumble of heroes &amp; villains, leading into *Secret Wars*. I imagine the film ending on an (intentionally) jarring hopeful note after all the multiversal carnage, with everyone happy &amp; content under their ruler Kang (who now has the control that he sought) and having no idea of their past lives. But perhaps there are one or two who discover the truth in *Secret Wars*, and then the final fight against Kang will be the climax of the Multiverse Saga.

Again, I apologise if this isn't entirely original but I thought it would be an interesting take on the material with its own twist as the MCU often does. Sidenote - I'm honestly not sure if Doom will be involved at all, it might be too much to fit in him along with everyone else. Curious to know what everyone's thoughts are!"

marvelstudios,One of the most underappreciated aspects of the Antman movies are its creative action sequences. How far do you agree?,-
marvelstudios,mcu hate,I honestly don‚Äôt understand why the new phase of marvel is getting so much hate as of lately. I acknowledge that it‚Äôs so much different then the infinity saga but isn‚Äôt that a good thing? they are introducing new characters and plots. it would be boring if they kept using the same characters and plots over and over again.
marvelstudios,Quantumania Character Arcs," It was fun, and Michelle Pffeifer and Jonathan Majors were both brilliant.
Despite some fertile building blocks, the character arcs were missing bits, and I‚Äôm not sure if they were cut or just never there. But the epic scale didn‚Äôt always work. 
The payoffs at the end didn‚Äôt seem to have been built to effectively - it‚Äôs telling that I felt more catharsis at the sight of a man playing electric drums in my Ant Man &amp; the Wasp rewatch than I did at an evil army being brought down by a rebellion. 

The pacing seemed weirdly off in some of the early scenes (eg with Krylar) which made it seem quite ‚Äò emotionally distant‚Äô in a Star Wars prequels sort of way- think it was in the directing and editing, rather than writing and performance. 

There was a post here a few days ago about the trailer accidentally selling a better movie where Scott is offered the deal to turn back time. I also thought this was what we were getting and wish we had. 

If Kang had offered Scott the same deal he offered Janet, and we had the dramatic irony of knowing what he was like 
And Scott takes it because he sees Cassie getting in trouble/sent to jail and thinks he‚Äôs fucked up by being absent and needs to go back and sort it out.
But then, through seeing Cassie with the Freedom Fighters, and redeeming Darren, he realises she is an impressive young woman.
(I think the core idea of Cassie redeeming the monster who frightened her as a child is great, but maybe needed more set up?) 

And then there are parallels with the Janet and Hope story - where there is guilt for not just not being there for her, but actively giving up a route back. Could Jan have had a moment with Scott to make them realise their daughters were fine without them? 
(Perhaps there would have been mileage in Hope encountering Kang without Jan there to explain her side - where she is frustrated her Mum isn‚Äôt sharing, then gets to the Quantum Realm and is told that the subjugation is Janet‚Äôs fault, and starts to doubt her mother? Might have given Evangeline Lilly some more to play, at least‚Ä¶)"
marvelstudios,So what‚Äôs the deal with Kang?,"So basically, at the end of antman we see all these kangs. Did all these kangs ‚Äúwin‚Äù their realities? Did they all become the smartest and create the multiverse machine and end up at the arena? Is that what makes Kang so scary in that he is always winning his reality and conquering it? So even if you defeat him, any new reality created will have another Kang dominate it?"

marvelstudios,Gap Junction Multiverse Question,"Ok so this is probably the most specific question ever, but i always have those very random questions so let me share with y'all:

In MoM, we learned about the Gap Junction, a place that holds the Book of Vishanti, and exists ""in between"" universes (so it's kinda like it exists outside of the Multiverse).

When Wanda destroyed the Book of Vishanti, that technically affects the entire Multiverse, since anyone that goes there in the entire Multiverse will found the empty place with the Book destroyed.

So what would happen if someone goes back in time, and then goes to the Gap Junction? Will it still be affected by the events of MoM?

Same logic applies to going back in time and getting a Darkhold after Wanda destroyed all of them in the entire Multiverse."
marvelstudios,Is there an official updated poster book that includes Phase 4's posters too? Or an official MCU character book?,"I met Elizabeth Olsen this weekend during Comfest Con Kuwait, and had her sign my Darkhold comic

After this, I got the idea to buy a poster book, or a character book, so if I met any of the other MCU actors/actresses, i'd just collect all their autographs in that one book

I've heard of ‚ÄúThe Infinity Saga‚Äù Poster book, but I was wondering if there was an official book that had phases 1-4 movie (and show) posters in them!

Or, if there is an official MCU character book, where each page has a different MCU (or Marvel in general) character, I can get each actor/actress to sign their own character's page

I tried searching, but the only official ones I could find were the Infinity Saga ones (I think there are separate ones for each phase). For the rest that I found, i'm not sure if they're official (or what i'm looking for) since I don't keep up with Marvel merch as much 

So I wanted to ask you guys! I've always wanted to do this but thought I'd never meet any of them since celebs rarely come to my country, but after Elizabeth cane here, i'm hopeful! And i'm older, so I can save up money to go to conventions outside of my country to meet them (hopefully lol)

marvelstudios,"A Parallel: The ""Probability Storm"" of Kangs","I just saw Ant-Man yesterday, so apologies if this is a redundant post. But there's a parallel in this film that I haven't seen discussed much and that makes me a bit less baffled/disappointed with what happens with Kang the Conqueror at the end of the movie. And that's the parallel between the Ant Man probability storm sequence and the idea of a multitude of Kangs. When Scott was trying to get the core and kept duplicating, MODOK and Kang were surprised at how all the Scott's, which represent all the varied choices Scott could make, worked together toward one common goal and how that made him stronger and more formidable in that moment. I struggled with the fact that Kang the Conquerer was so easily defeated (?) by a lower-level Avenger like Ant-Man, when he's supposed to be built up as a Thanos-level threat and the worst of his variants. It seemed to undermine the idea that he is a major villain that will require the efforts of all of our heroes to thwart. But then I accepted that the threat is not the concept of an individual Kang, or even the *worst* individual Kang. It's the idea of how formidable a multitude of Kang's is when they work in pursuit of a common, nefarious goal. And maybe, as a result, we're *supposed* to underestimate him the way that MODOK underestimated Scott in the probability storm. I thought the first end-credit scene was kind of odd, tonally, with all the Kang's hooting and cheering. But I think it was an interesting parallel to the probability scene earlier.  Effectively, Quantumania enters the MCU into an in-universe probability storm with respect to Kang. I don't feel like, at the end of the movie, we're much further along in the understanding of the threat than we were at the end of Loki. It feels like we're in a similar place narratively, and I think the movie definitely could have been better at various points. But I enjoyed it and am interested in seeing what they do with many variations of the same villain, with seemingly different power levels.  At the very least, it gives Jonathan Majors an opportunity to continue to show his impressive range!"

marvelstudios,"""Can we both be forgotten together?""","In a deleted scene from ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" MJ says to Peter Parker, ""Can we both be forgotten together?"" If Peter had gone along with it, the movie would have been a lot sadder, but luckily, he didn't. The scene worked well with just Peter Parker being forgotten; it showed us how far he had come. He learned that his mistakes have consequences, and nobody but him should pay for them.

""You have a gift. You have power, and with great power, there must also come great responsibility.""

I look back at Spider-Man: Homecoming, and it's really incredible how much he has grown as a character, both emotionally and physically. He went from wanting to save the world to saving the universe.

""Liberated from having to juggle two lives. Peter Parker is no more, but Spider-Man lives on...""

I hope everything works out for him in the next trilogy."

marvelstudios,The big problem when they finally do the Young Avengers,"I think the Young Avengers is a great concept for the MCU and one they are obviously building towards but I see one problem. Both Kate Bishop and Cassie Lang are played by actresses who just turned 26 and by the time they get to an actual Young Avengers movie or show both could be around 30 making them hardly Young Avengers age even if they ""look young."" Kind of makes you wonder on the Cassie recast. In the comics I think she's supposed to be about 15 when they form while I believe Kate is the oldest and is 18 or 19. 

In Iron Man 2 you had a 26 year old Black Widow as a point of comparison.  And you now have a 27 year old Yelena."

marvelstudios,Could Vision beat Thanos in a 1v1?,"(Specific to the MCU)

My basis for this idea is that Vision makes short work of Ultron and Ultron (in the What If? episode) easily kills Zombie Thanos.

Moreover, Vision's power is from the mind stone and the only other two characters we know are stronger than Thanos - Carol and Wanda - also have infinity stone-based powers, so that could say something about his weaknesses/their power levels.

It could also explain why one of the Black Order's first move when they attacked earth was to maim/try and kill Vision. He was a big threat to Thanos before he got knifed.

He can no longer rely on Happy, Pepper, or anyone. So what will he do for income? 
I have a couple of ideas that could fit.



Daily Bugle: Since JJJ is now on the hunt for the true identity of the webbed menace again. Peter could get a job there submitting photos for JJJ and while also feeding him fake news to mislead him. Really just want more JK Simmons in the MCU and it's Peter Parker's most well known job to the general audience.



Future Foundation: With the mystery of who bought Stark Tower still out there, it's still possible that it becomes the Baxter Building and home to the Fantastic Four. With an MCU highlight being the Tony/Peter relationship, being that mentor/student dynamic, Reed could become a new mentor for Peter to look up to. Plus any excuse to see Peter suit up in the Future Foundation suit would be incredible to see live action.


Those are the two that I think would be fun or interesting to see play out but I was wondering if anybody has any other ideas or theories for what the next steps for Peter are."

marvelstudios,Future of the MCU,"One of the biggest ""concerns"" (more like an observation) I have with the future of the MCU is how we'll miss out on so many of the comic storylines. 

Let me explain.  
In the comics, we see an established Avengers team with a full roster and compound exist in the same universe as the X-men and F4. We see Iron Man and Wolverine in the same stories, Dr. Doom do battle with Thor and Hulk. 

I'm aware that it's unrealistic to think that many Characters can exist in the same time frame just due to real world restrictions( actors,  budgets, release dates, etc.)

 But do you think we might see a soft reset in the MCU 10ish years down the road?  Where a new cast is introduced to portray the original Avengers alongside the upcoming X-men?

Title.

I‚Äòm slowly catching on with Phase 4 and just saw Love &amp; Thunder after I‚Äôve read all those scathing reviews from critics and audience alike, but honestly: I don‚Äôt get it. 

Phase 4 in general was pretty terrible in my opinion, but this was by far the movie I had the most fun with and enjoyed the most. I think the cinematography was great, the CGI was decent and in some scenes phenomenal (way better than MoM in my opinion besides some of the lightning effects maybe) and the story - while being nonsense - was carried by strong performances of the cast. 

At least this movie had a good pace and wasn‚Äôt overly long and boring. And I found it to be very funny, silly humor, but funny - especially the part with all the other Gods and those New Asgard scenes. It was lighthearted yet meaningful. I never got the high praise for Ragnarok, even after rewatching it I just found it entertaining and good, but honestly, this movie for me was better. Controversial opinion, I know. 

So I‚Äôm curious, why is Love &amp; Thunder disregarded by so many? Why does this movie get so much ridicule?"

marvelstudios,Theory: Ant-Man 4 will come out in the future,"Quantumania released and it was good in my opinion but just like Thor: Ragnarok, they didn‚Äôt end the movie with something emotional like Peter Parker losing everything in the MCU in his third film etc. Overall, it just didn‚Äôt feel like a conclusion to Ant-Man‚Äôs story which leads to me to believe Marvel will probably make a fourth and final Ant-Man movie to conclude Scott Lang‚Äôs story, In his series of movies at least. I feel like Marvel was planning Quantumania to be a setup of the next Avengers movie just like how the end of Thor: Ragnarok was a setup of Infinity War but with the exception of Ant-Man actually losing something/someone or learning something new."
marvelstudios,About Kang in Quantumania,"I think he's the same one as the one in Loki. When the one in Loki was killed, the time-line rewrote itself, which made possible the existence of his variations, but he also existed in the past, so he himself would also be restored, in the movie he talks about his plan, and it is pretty much the exact same thing as the one in Loki.

marvelstudios,Kang was SO disappointing,"Was anyone else really disappointed with Kang's characterization?  Perhaps it's my fault, as I was expecting someone like He Who Remains, in the sense that he was this presumably normal human who also happened to be a genius.  He had no superpowers, no special abilities, but even Loki was terrified of him because of how brilliantly he was able to manipulate time to Machiavellianize his way into power and control.

Instead, we got essentially another guy in a superpowered suit, his danger being that his suit was stronger and more dangerous than the previous ones.  I dunno just found him underwhelming."
marvelstudios,MCU is dead and there‚Äôs no way to redeem it now after Antman,"Good. You caught the bait and you‚Äôre here. There‚Äôs 3M people on this subreddit alone. 3M. Think about that number. Think about the number of people now, who don‚Äôt use Reddit but are marvel fans. Now think about the number of people who watch every MCU movie but their life doesn‚Äôt revolve around it. Now think about the number of people who watch a marvel movie through word of mouth. Also take into consideration that there are die hard MCU fans who barely survey online forums and never will and you‚Äôll never know about them or what they think of. 

The people on this sub will always have favourable reviews towards any project that comes out more so than the rest that watch MCU movies and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs a given even. However, if a project doesn‚Äôt perform up to its expectations, and people rightfully criticise it, they‚Äôre not always ‚Äúhaters‚Äù they‚Äôre just dissatisfied with the project that‚Äôs been put out and hasn‚Äôt lived up to expectations. The average MCU fan (forget this subreddit, not everyone is chronically online) agrees that the trailer and post credit scene was the best part about Antman. Criticism where criticism is due is acceptable and it won‚Äôt kill the universe to admit that Antman was not on par with what everyone was expecting specially with the writing, plot and how Kang was dealt with. 

Riding hard for a mediocre project will do more harm than good for the future of the universe. MCU won‚Äôt die with a single project because the foundation is strong enough and there will always be a way to pull it back."

marvelstudios,"After Quantumania, I really hope the MCU gives us more hand to hand scenes","In a few of past movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home, Quantumania, and of course Shang Chi the most exciting parts I‚Äôve found were the hand to hand combat scenes because they are always portrayed as brutal and show case raw strength and skill between the hero and villain. 

I won‚Äôt go into much detail for Antman since it‚Äôs still new, but seeing just what Kang can do just as a person with no tech was one of the most exciting scenes in that movie. 

In Shang Chi, I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to go into much detail here since half of the movie is hand to hand. But when they did it, it was portrayed as suspenseful and exciting, once again showing the skill and power of each character. 

Spider-Man: No Way Home had probably my favorite fight scene and hand to hand since Winter Soldier. Show casing just how powerful the Green Goblin was in the apartment fight making Peter look hopeless even with repeated punches to the face, then later showing why you don‚Äôt piss Spider-Man off at the Statue of Liberty. 

I really hope they show more of this side of Marvel with the characters who have the ability to fight hand to hand, especially with more street level characters being introduced. When done right, they‚Äôre some of the most exciting scenes in the movie!"
marvelstudios,Just saw Quantumania and here is the problem,"The movie isn‚Äôt terrible I actually enjoyed it more than Thor L&amp;T. Quantumania I give a 7/10 personally, not as good as Ant Man 1 and a little bit better than Ant Man and The Wasp.

The problem is it‚Äôs forgettable, like Thor L&amp;T. Now by no means am I a super fan or someone that knows the comics well at all but I haven‚Äôt felt the feeling that The Avenger‚Äôs gave me in any other movies. You know the chills when Captain America shows up to save Wanda in Infinity War.

marvelstudios,"There seems to be a lot of hot takes and very premature proclamations about the MCU right now, and I think everyone needs to take a second and just relax","It seems with AW: Quantumania, more so than previous MCU movies from phase 4, there are a number of people declaring Marvel Studios to be dead or on the decline. This subreddit seems to be teeming with it. 

Has there been some mixed quality since Endgame? Sure. Has Marvel Studios and Feige overextended themselves? One could have valid evidence to make that argument. However, I objectively believe it‚Äôs a mistake to make bold proclamations about the state or fate of the MCU, considering Kevin Feige just capped off one the of greatest 10 year runs in cinema history, both critically and at the box office. It‚Äôs historic. The last couple years, not so much. Which segues into my next point. 

Disney and Marvel Studios were already changing gears since Iger took back over. Less content. Better quality. That seems to be the aim. Phase 4 suffered as a result of taking the opposite approach. With that said, let Quantumania be the sacrificial lamb both critically and at the box office. That‚Äôs good. Let Quantumania bomb. It should only drive the quality over quantity point home even further. Doesn‚Äôt mean the MCU is dead. Just means changes are needed, and I‚Äôd say with this debacle changes have already happened and will probably continue to happen, both with release dates into the future and maybe even with writers as well. Feige and Disney are definitely listening. If they weren‚Äôt, The Marvels wouldn‚Äôt of been delayed. There is gonna be an emphasis on quality again. Don‚Äôt be surprised to see more release dates move and writers that were attached to projects previously, exit those projects. 

There‚Äôs a lot of people engraving the MCU‚Äôs tombstone and I really think in several years when Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars comes out, that‚Äôs gonna end up looking like a mistake. All Marvel Studios has to do to recapture that momentum is just make good movies. Feige and Iger have a track record. It‚Äôs not hard to fathom. Put an emphasis on quality, and all phase 4 and Quantumania will look like a speed bump in hindsight. People are full of hot reactionary takes right now. Let this play out see where it goes and what happens."

Shooting Thor does nothing.

And so on.

Trying to make any difference against super beings when all you have is a gun and a uniform does nothing.

But time and time again, there it is.  We all know how much the USA loves to jerk itself off with throwing the military in any action movie (Transformers is another stupid example), and it's really irritating to say the least.  I'm watching AoU and there's a short scene where soldiers, in slow motion, are exiting vehicles and running in unicen - so that they can point guns at the Hulk.  I feel like they would have a general idea who the Hulk is and that guns won't do dick in that situation.  

It's tiring.  It's boring.  It's straight up lazy.  And it's ridiculous.  They can do better, yet they choose not to."

And the Infinity Stone arc was just incredible - so many movies leading up to that three-film crescendo. 

It deserved all the money it made. 

And that's where the hell starts. Every corporate owner of every single other creative property eyed Marvel's billions jealously and wanted in on the action. 

So now we're getting a flood of mediocre American-style drivel whose only purpose is to set up a 'universe'. 

Warner Bros want to make more Lord of the Ring movies, yet haven't made anything decent with that franchise in 20 years. 

Jurassic Park has devolved from having movies that defined genres, to whatever is happening now. Human cloning? 

Universal wanted to create their dark universe with Dracula and the boys, but it wasn't something anybody was after, and besides, we could all tell it was being down for the money, not for the fans. 

Anyway, that's it. I hope all the production houses prioritise making good movies instead of universes"

marvelstudios,Kang and the timelines,"I've seen a lot of discussion on how there timelines and Kang works story wise.

After watching anthem 3 and revisiting Loki my understanding has changed of how the TVA Kang and the timelines work.

I used to thing the scared timeline was all there was after HWRs created the TVA and used alioth to prime all branching timelines. The branching timelines prevented other kangs from coming into existence then kick-starting anothe multiversal war.

I also thought th universes and timelines were the same thing. Where new universe were created when branches of the scared timeline happens.

Now after rewatching Loki and watch Kang explain to Janet about the timelines. I think the HWRs like he says in episode 6 he ""isolated"" his timeline (where all the universe's that made a version HWRs were strung into the ring we saw)

All the other Kangs were still around however could no longer interact or threatened the sacred timeline.  Alioth prevented the bridge between timelines. So he ended the multiversal war for himself.

 The branch's that followed HWRs death started to mix and clash with other timelines causing incursions. I also now think timelines are a collection of infinite universes that have same vents played out, but characters look different hence why the Loki's variant all looked different in HWRs sacred timeline.

Hope this makes sense. If not feel free to put holes in this."

marvelstudios,Are people being too negative?,"So I saw Quantumania and was concerned going in because I had heard of the insanely low reviews this movie was getting and when the movie was done i walked out...

Confused. Because I loved it.

Almost everything with Quantumania and all the discourse I've seen online about it I guess has finally pushed me to vent this opinion. The fandom has turned intensely hypercritical and ludicrously negative. Now, I am not one of those absolutely obsessed, ""fans"" who cry that Marvel Studios has never made a mistake once in their existence. That's not true they have made mistakes, some I will never forgive them for, but I also do not entirely understand the recent wave of insane negativity surrounding most projects they've released starting in Phase 4. 

Out of all of P4 there were only 4 projects that I thought were either mediocre or just plain bad. I think so many people got caught up in the hype of Endgame that they just expect every new movie to be some big world changing event or to clearly move the plot along. But by getting caught up in wanting the big stuff I feel like they miss out on enjoying the small stuff again. 

Obviously this is all my dumb opinion and you are more than welcome to disagree with me, (if you've actually read this far, hi thanks for reading my dumb opinion), but idk. I guess the strong vocal negativity of the fanbase is getting to me recently,

 I love Marvel Studios, and I will continue to support their projects until they stop producing the investment and engagement I've come to expect from them. Thank you for reading this glorified rant typed at 4 am, feel free to tell me I'm wrong down below.

marvelstudios,Quantumania Under-appreciated Moment,"There is a moment I am not hearing talked about enough. The moment in the probability storm where Hope grabs Scott‚Äôs hand and all versions of themselves coalesce in one of each is breathtaking. Top 5 MCU visuals for me along with the portal scene, mysterio‚Äôs illusion, Thor bridge entrance in ragnarok and Loki and Sylvie versus Alioth. Am I crazy?"
marvelstudios,The formula that could save the MCU (it worked before),"The Infinity Saga was a perfect arc of moviemaking. That much is clear, especially now that we have the Multiverse Saga to compare it to.

The decade that brought us the 23 movies of the Infinity Saga had a few clunkers along the way, but in retrospect, it was an incredible achievement. The writing, acting, cinematography and cohesive culture linking them all together was truly a modern achievement. 

So why does the Multiverse Saga pale by comparison? What made the first arc of films so damn strong? I suggest it boils down to three key elements:

-	**Limited Core Team** - The brilliance of the first saga was in establishing three core centerpiece heroes to start - Iron Man, Captain America and Thor - around whom to create the universe of characters. Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye were introduced as embedded in the narratives of the other three, leading to the first Avengers film. The team cohesion was essential.

-	**Iterative Introduction Arcs** - After that first iteration, a new cluster was developed with Ant-Man, Black Panther and Spider-Man to live into the world of the core team. GotG, Doctor Strange and Captain Marvel were introduced as boundary spanning narratives, augmenting the core Thanos story by setting them on a course to intersect. These iterative cycles were incredibly well done by maintaining a central story arc and slowly showing how these new characters eventually live in to it.

-	**Tethered Post Credit Scenes** - The MCU made after-credit scenes a thing, and used them to connect the dots. At first, it was a Nick Fury assembling his team, and then it became glimpses of Thanos collecting the gauntlet. These were very effective ways to continue advancing a central plot and satisfying for the audience.

That‚Äôs it. The MCU secret sauce in a nutshell, and it is a framework that could easily be replicated in each and every saga without feeling redundant. It is a storytelling device that could be applied creatively to the current Multiverse storyline. 

Instead we‚Äôre getting a series of disconnected films without a central team.  We are eight films into this new saga and none of the central characters of the stand alone films have interacted with each other yet. The big baddie, who was introduced during a streaming show, has only made his cinematic appearance recently, 1/3 of the way through the saga.

The Nick Fury assembling-a-team thing has been relegated to a B-plot with JLD‚Äôs Valentina building an anti-hero group. There‚Äôs no central **feeling of team** that has been a go-to of Marvel comics forever. We need cohesion as the move-going audience and instead we‚Äôre getting disconnection. If that bringing-it-all-together is still coming soon, hopefully they‚Äôve learned a lesson of not waiting until halfway through the saga to introduce it.

We have been introduced to so many new characters, all with their own universes, it‚Äôs exhausting. Most of that is a function of the streaming shows, but does the Eternals even feel remotely the same world as Spider-Man? Shang-Chi was promising, but it feels like it‚Äôs been so damn long since we were introduce to that world and yet it was just 18 months ago. The volume of character introductions in the interim has exhausted the audience.

Lastly, the post-credit scenes have largely been used to introduce even more characters! Who the heck is Charlize Theron playing? Stick around 8-10 films and shows and maybe we‚Äôll tell you. It‚Äôs starting to feel like *Lost*, or the recent run of Star Wars films, where you have a bunch of writers but no one knitting it all together. I am no longer trusting the process.

What a complete fumble of the ball. The MCU coming out of Avengers: Endgame was the 1990s Yankees or 2010s Patriots - a monolith of winning. And instead of sticking with a formula that could have been replicated endlessly while introducing new storylines, they got greedy and reinvented, overstuffing the character pipeline and cranking out disconnected plot. 

It is a classic mistake that has brought down every great pop culture thing, from Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch Kids to Must See TV and Grunge Music. When something works, the entertainment industry is always right there to pump steroids into it in hopes of tripling profitability. 

But the good news? There is still time to get back to what worked the first go-around. The slowing down of streaming shows will help a ton, and finally getting to Kang was essential. We get it that Secret Wars is where we‚Äôll see Moon Knight and She-Hulk interact. Between now and then, get a core team together and start linking the mess.

I‚Äôve got maybe 2-3 more movies before I lose my love of the MCU completely - a franchise that I thought could do no wrong coming out of Engame just four years ago. 

Talk about fumbling the ball, damn."

marvelstudios,Iron Fist S1: Review,"Howdy Partner ya looking mighty nice today.

Last night I finished Iron Fist Season 1. And I think it's pretty overhated. 

All of the villains were really interesting, especially Harold Meachum and Bakuto. 

This show had a way of giving you bits of information at a time, and it worked. The mystery of how Danny's parents died kept me head scratching for the whole series. And when it was revealed that Harold killed them that was a real gut punch.

It was nice to see some returning characters from Daredevil, in Madame Gao and Claire. Any mention of Daredevil made me scream inside. 

Ward had a massive character arc throughout the series, as he went from wanting Danny arrested to helping him kill his own father. For most of the series, I thought Joy was the better of the siblings, but with Ward's redemption arc I've changed my mind.  

Colleen Wing was an interesting love interest for Danny, as she was part of the Hand for most of the series, until realising the truth. 

I'll be starting the Defenders soon, and then it's on to Daredevil Season 3. 

But with that said, Good Riddance and Stay safe. Have a Good Day."
marvelstudios,I just had a wacky dream of Happy becoming Iron Man.,"So I had this weird fantasy dream where I was watching a marvel movie from a third person perspective.

I don't remember the details in the beginning and near end, but the general story is that Whiplash is attacking the Shield Headquarters and the power in the entire building is gone.

Happy follows a bald bearded man who I now realize was Lex Luther (the Arrowverse version), he tells that he has something that could beat Whiplash.

They walk up a short flight of stairs when the elevator doesn't work and reach an empty office (because my brain is too lazy to fill out the minor details) and he flips a switch which elevates a hidden cylinder compartment from the floor that contains the classic iron man suit (the first movie).

I remember Lex saying something along the lines: ""they couldn't break this..."" and gestures the suit towards Happy who in an annoyed tone explain that he's not Tony Stark and the minor arc reactor on his chest is actually a life support gear (The scene then shows what looks like an iron man costume's plastic chest piece with an LED triangular arc reactor module placed lazily over Happy's business suit, he didn't even had it before the scene).

This leaves Lex in shock but before he could say anything, Whiplash comes out of nowhere and starts attacking. He was in the middle of whipping Lex when a concussive ray blast hits him in the chest and pushes the villain back.

The scene then shifts to Happy in an iron man suit who despite the earlier argument and through dream logic, somehow he is able to rewire his arc reactor to the suit and use it to slightly power the suit to a mere optimal degree.

The fight ensues with Whiplash madly whipping at Happy with his electrified whips like an angry maniac and Happy fallen on the floor and shooting random blasts every few seconds in a panic while getting constantly attacked and damaging the suit.

Sadly, this is the only thing I remember as the scene shifts to something completely unrelated and I have forgotten the rest."
marvelstudios,"""Morbius"" was better than ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""","I'm serious.

I just watched both for the first time. After all the bad stuff I heard about ""Morbius"", I went in with extremely low expectations. I was utterly surprised to discover that I enjoyed it. Not a masterpiece by any means but it kept me entertained and I wasn't bored.

""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" had me bored to tears. I literally fell asleep *twice*. The RT score is currently at 84% so I expected greatness. What I got was a slow, boring movie that was very depressing and had a villain who kept reminding me of ""Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians: The Lightning Thief""."

marvelstudios,My FOX X-Men Headcanon,"It is well known that the Fox X-Men movies are a canonical mess.  When doing a full marathon of these movies, it makes no sense why in The Last Stand Angel is a child in the 2000s but in Apocalyspe he is a teenager fighting in an East German fight club. These characters showing up at different points in the timeline have led me to devise enough mental gymnastics to make ALL of it canon. 


As stated in Avengers Endgame, when you change the past, you do not change the future, you create a new timeline. I believe the X-Men films follow two seperate timelines, with one of those timelines having two possible endings.

The two timelines can be broken into the Original Timeline and the Altered Timeline. We see these two interact in Days of Future Past. Perhaps Kitty Pryde's power was to slide between timelines, rather than between time itself. 

First off, there is the Original Timeline. These follow the adventures of Patrick Stewart's Xavier, and how he started the X-Men in the 1980s with the mutants he rescued from the Weapon X facility (Origins: Wolverine). Cyclops would be the only who stayed on, and he recruits Jean a few years later (The Last Stand). Proffessor X is still killed by Jean, but is replaced by the man scene with Moira McTaggert at the end of the film. Wolverine teams up with this replacement at the end of The Wolverine, and Magneto returns his claws. 

Here's where it gets fun. 

This Xavier and Logan are the same two who we see in Logan, which I would pose is the original ending to this timeline. The two never mention time-travel, or the events of Days of Future Past. It is safe to say then, that these events do not happen in this timeline. It is also never specified if Cyclops and Jean are killed by Charles at the X-Mansion, so we cannot be sure if it is the Days of Future Past timeline. As it stands, Logan is the last film.

However, because of the events of Days of Future Past, we know that there is a timeline in which the OT X-Men end up safely at the X-Mansion. By changing the past, we've created a new outcome for the OT, which serves as a ""Good Ending"". Logan is the unaltered ""Bad Ending"". Both films can be seen as canon. 


ORIGINAL TIMELINE
1. X-Men Origins: Wolverine
2. X-Men 
3. X2
4. X-Men: The Last Stand
5. The Wolverine
6. Logan / Days of Future Past

The next set of films follow a different path from the very beginning. This Altered Timeline follows James McAvoy's Proffessor X, and his close relationship with Mystique, whom he now meets in the 1940s/1950s sometime. He meets Erik later than the OT, and we see characters start to show up in different times, with different powers. Colossus is much larger than the OT, as is Juggernaut. Emma frost is in the Hellfire Club in the 1960s rather than Weapon X in the 1980s. 

Deadpool shares this timeline, as seen in Deadpool 2 when the X-Men are clearly McAvoy's.

Well you may be wondering, ""Days of Future Past occurs after First Class, how come there are already changes?"" It is very simple. 

In Deadpool 2, we see him use the time-watch to go back and kill young Ryan Reynolds and younger Deadpool. But in the extended edition, we see Deadpool going back to 1880 to kill baby Hitler. He doesn't but this does action of going back activates the butterfly effect that leads to the changes we see in this Altered Timeline. Wade going back to kill Hitler is what causes First Class, and then Days of Future Past further deviates. 

ALTERED TIMELINE
1. X-Men: First Class
2. Days of Future Past
3. Apocalyspe 
4. Dark Phoenix

marvelstudios,[Spoilers] Is that character in a certain post credits scene a cyborg?,"SPOILER WARNING FOR ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA!!












In the post credits scene where we get the reveal of the Council of Kangs lead by Rama-Tut and two other Kangs (whose names I don‚Äôt know), did Rama-Tut look‚Ä¶cybernetic to anyone else?

For all I know it‚Äôs just armor or the lighting, but it looked to me like he had a robotic lower half and robotic arms, which could be that Kang‚Äôs version of his tech to get to the CoK meeting place.

I‚Äôm probably looking too far into it, but what do you guys think? Side note, who were the other two prominent Kangs with Rama-Tut?"

marvelstudios,Missed Opportunities in the MCU,"Ever notice when a Marvel movie sets up a perfect payoff and then just ‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt pay it off? I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äúplot holes‚Äù, I mean Chekov‚Äôs Guns that never fire. I can‚Äôt blame them‚Äînot just because I‚Äôm not a writer, producer or a director myself, but because they‚Äôve been doing something never really done before in cinema.

But ‚Ä¶ sometimes the setup is so clear that the failure to land is painful.

Here‚Äôs a couple examples that have stuck with me:

‚Ä¢ THOR ends with the Rainbow Bridge dramatically destroyed and Thor sacrificing a life with Jane to save the Ice Giants. The movie ends with Jane researching how to reopen the Bridge from Earth, setting up a perfect character arc for their relationship. And then, in AVENGERS ‚Ä¶ Thor just appears on Earth and Jane gets whisked away, out of sight out of mind. Nothing to see here.

‚Ä¢ In BLACK WINDOW, Red Guardian brags about fighting Captain America, and by the end of the movie he gets to confront someone with all of the Avengers‚Äô fighting abilities. He could have gone down in glory, saving his family by holding Taskmaster at bay and proving at the same time that he could hold his ground with the best of them. 

Agree, disagree? Any other examples?"

marvelstudios,I was half-expecting Wasp to have a half-sibling,"When it was revealed that Janet had a relationship with Bill Murray's character, to be honest, I thought they might have revealed that she had a second kid in the quantum realm. 

Though I didn't further predict what this kid's role could be. Even still, didn't anyone have this thought? Amongst the comic characters yet to be brought into the MCU, could any fill the role of Janet's secend kid?  It is anyone from a villain, a hero or a regular civilian."

marvelstudios,Janet was definitely one of my favorite characters in Quantumania. Really hope we see more of her in the MCU!,-
marvelstudios,I believe people are to harsh on the Marvel Movies/Shows,"I find that people are super harsh to criticize the Marvel Franchise. Will i admit that Marvel although for phase 4, pushed for too much? Yes absolutely. But we honestly did receive some decent/good content during phase 4. Sure, some editing was, ugh to say the least. It was jam packed and quick but in a way I think kinda necessary for those heroes and villains. It would have taken many more years to give us these characters if they all received a film to show their story. 

And I‚Äôm not sure people would have been up for movies for all these characters. Some of the shows made sense to do. And let‚Äôs be honest, A lot of people only know of the original Avengers and that‚Äôs really about it. So seeing that people didn‚Äôt really jump on the band wagon for phase 4, makes sense. I mean once they killed off Iron Man, Original Caption America, and the Black Widow, it was somewhat understandable for people not to be so into these ‚Äúnew‚Äù characters. It wasn‚Äôt who the people ‚Äúknew‚Äù. 

A lot of people as well don‚Äôt know how much money, time, effort, go in to these films and shows. All the directors, screen writers, production designers, art directors, costume designers, cinematographer, editors, actors, etc. all of them are so important to creating these movies and shows for us and I believe we give them not enough credit. I mean honestly, ask yourself, have you made a movie? Have you spent months on end, possibly even over a year or so helping to create just a single 2 hour film or multi episode show? Probably not and that‚Äôs okay. But those people did, and those movies and tv shows mean everything to them. And America shit on them every time. It seemed no one had a true opinion about anything released. 

So I don‚Äôt know, this is a personal opinion of mine and everyone is entitled to their own about these! But maybe if you‚Äôre someone who has a ‚Äúhigh expectation‚Äù for these, I hope this can open your eyes and thoughts (just a little) to these shows and movies. You might watch them again and say ‚Äúdamn, that actually wasn‚Äôt too bad‚Äù."

marvelstudios,I really hope the MCU emphasises the obsessive side of Reed's personality. Him being so focused on his work that he ignores those around him is fascinating to me.,-
marvelstudios,Shuri was insufferable in Wakanda Forever,"I don't know if anyone else felt this way, but I thought that the writing and dialogue for Shuri (and the MIT girl whose name I can't remember) was awful. This is going to sound bad, but I don't know how else to say it, so just try to bear with me. 

They did this in the first one too, but it wasn't as bad. 

Really smart people usually don't talk like that. Ever. They don't use excessively big words and try to sound smart. People who want people to believe they're really smart do shit like that. Or nerds who read a lot and weren't that socialized. The smartest people (of which both Shuri and MIT girl would be) in a college classroom are usually quiet and just know shit. They don't show off. The next smartest people would maybe be like that, trying to get people to think they're at the top. 

The thought that just kept popping through my head is ""Does Marvel think their African American viewers (who are a main audience for this movie) think that they aren't smart enough to understand what a real smart person would act like?"" Did it have to be spoon fed to them? It felt like racism of low expectations to me. Even though it was directed by a black director. Maybe he doesn't know what smart people sound like or had to deal with shitty writing. Idk.

The dialogue felt so forced and made the movie hard to watch. It just happened more often than what would have been normal. The first black panther did it a little bit, but it was tolerable and not as noticeable. I thought they were just trying to push it a little bit in order to get people to know she was smart. But this movie...my lord."

marvelstudios,Kang vs [SPOILER],"Confession: I bought the idea of Hank Pym defeating Kang with his aged, robo-intellect, ""Socialist"" Ant army. Mostly because each film basically made each Ant-Fam member get the final blow to defeating Kang (meh on Hope since it was co-op with Kang in the last last fight).



However, some seem to omit that the Ants were that stronger in numbers and thought those ants were not that powerful to overpower Kang; personally, I suspended disbelief since Pym was never supposed to be alive at this point and his ants matter in Marvel."
marvelstudios,"Can Someone Explain Kang ""the Conqueror"" to Me?","I'm trying to understand why Kang was easily dispatched after being feared so much by Janet and the rest of the Quantum Realm through the first third of the film. I've read that this Kang isn't the main villain (Council of Kangs) but they went out of their way to label this one as ""the conqueror"".....Is he not the most iconic Kang of the comics?

Not saying he has to be Thanos, but wouldn't it have been more effective if he at least took out a hero or two before being sucked into the machine? 

I came out of the theatre so underwhelmed, but I'm hoping someone with a little more knowledge of the source material can let me know just why the Council and not the Conqueror are the true antagonist to fear."

marvelstudios,Do we really thing Kang The Conqueror is dead in Antman?,"I see a lot of people trashing Kang dying in the new Antman movie. At first I was annoyed with how he died and how big of a game he talked just to be taken down by ants and then killed by Scott and Hope. 

But then I thought, there‚Äôs no way marvel is that dumb. First off, they even say ‚ÄúKang will return‚Äù at the end of the credits. If they truly killed of Kang The Conqueror then they wouldn‚Äôt need to say this. It‚Äôs obvious the council of kangs are going to return and show up in a future movie(s). 

Secondly, he says he has killed avengers before and even says he killed Thor, one of the most powerful avengers, if not the most powerful. If he can kill Thor then he can easily kill Antman. Marvel isn‚Äôt that oblivious to the script they are writing. This makes me believe Kang the Conqueror lost on purpose and just gave off a really good show because he loves theatrics and also he has to make it believable so Scott and everyone else doesn‚Äôt question whether or not he is dead (Scott does actually question it . Foreshadowing?) 

Thirdly, this Kang was exiled by those three other, very powerful kangs. Kang The Conqueror was too powerful for them to kill. In the first post credit scene they mention to each other how mad the one Kang must be that he wasn‚Äôt the one who killed him. If they couldn‚Äôt kill him, what makes us think Antman could? 

Also, the trio of kangs were aware of Kang The Conqueror was ‚Äúkilled‚Äù therefore they know of his whereabouts. Had he actually gotten out of the quantum realm, they would have tracked him down and killed him or exiled him. The Conqueror has to know this. He has to know even if he had gotten out that it wouldn‚Äôt have really mattered and he would have lost again. 

Lastly, his death at the end of the movie could have been written different ways that didn‚Äôt involve the multiverse engine. The writers wanted to involve it. They actually didn‚Äôt even have to kill him. They could have taken the engine, gone through the portal and just leave Kang behind in the multiverse being watched by those he mistreated now that his army was defeated and power was given back to the oppressed. There‚Äôs also other ways to have him defeated. 

So I think, whether it was kang‚Äôs plan or not, that he isn‚Äôt dead. I think he is trapped inside the world engine surrounded by millions of replicas of himself, just like Scott was, and will come together with his other forms and somehow come out of the engine. They kept 

You don‚Äôt just hype up a character that much just to have him nearly defeated by ants (no matter how smart they are) and then defeated by Antman and the wasp. The ants are actually a foreshadowing of what will happen to Kang in the multiverse engine. He will spend hundreds or thousands of years, like the ants did, gaining knowledge and power and eventually be more powerful than ever. 

Thoughts?"
