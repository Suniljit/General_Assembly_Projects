# General_Assembly_Projects
Hi, during the course of study in General Assembly's Data Science Immersive, I have undertaken the following projects. I hope you find them useful and do reach out to me through Linkedin if you have any questions for feedback. Thank you.

### Project 1 : Does Rainy Weather Increase Healthcare Cases?  
In this project, we'll be conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to see if the number of healthcare cases in Singapore increase during rainy weather. In particular, we will look into the increase in flu cases, dengue cases and road accidents. If the above statement is true, it could allow the healthcare industry to better plan their resources as well as take the necessary preventive steps to mitigate such issues.   
*The presentation slides attached are on a different topic, as we chose our groupmate's project for the presentaton component.*

### Project 2 : An Analysis of HDB Resale Prices and its Factors for Predictions  
Here, we'll be using the entire data science process to perform a linear regression analysis to predict HDB resale prices in Singapore, and also identify the significant features that contributes to the price.   

### Project 3 : Digitalizing our Marketing and Branding Infringement Checks
In this project, we will be implementing various classification models to conduct NLP and classify reddit posts as either from MCU or DCEU. This model can then be used to check for infringement in text documents between MCU and DCEU (e.g. if a publication is related to MCU, the model can check if any DCEU specific information has accidentally been included inside).

### Project 4 : Forecasting Dengue Cases in Singapore
Here, we'll be using time-series and other regression models to forecast dengue cases 16 weeks into the future, so help authorities better time the deployment of Project Wolbachia to suppress dengue mosquito populations. 

### Capstone Project: Topic Modeling of Academic Journals (Model Based Systesm Engineering)
This project leverages unsupervised learning techniques to gain valuable insights into themes and trends within the Systems Engineering industry. These insights serve as a guiding force for shaping our organization's short-term and long-term goals.
