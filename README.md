### Project 1 : Does Rainy Weather Increase Healthcare Cases?  
In this project, we'll be conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to see if the number of healthcare cases in Singapore increase during rainy weather. In particular, we will look into the increase in flu cases, dengue cases and road accidents. If the above statement is true, it could allow the healthcare industry to better plan their resources as well as take the necessary preventive steps to mitigate such issues.   
*The presentation slides attached are on a different topic, as we chose our groupmate's project for the presentaton component.*

### Project 2 : An Analysis of HDB Resale Prices and its Factors for Predictions  
Here, we'll be using the entire data science process to perform a linear regression analysis to predict HDB resale prices in Singapore, and also identify the significator features that contributes to the price.   

### Project 3 : Digitalizing our Marketing and Branding Infringement Checks
In this project, we will be implementing various classification models to conduct NLP and classify reddit posts as either from MCU or DCEU. This model can then be used to check for infringement in text documents between MCU and DCEU (e.g. if a publication is related to MCU, the model can check if any DCEU specific information has accidentally been included inside).
